Agriculture as Climate Solution: Insights from COP30 and Brazil's Sustainability Leadership
As the global conversation around climate action intensifies, the agricultural sector is stepping up not only as a stakeholder—but as a critical part of the solution. This session will include key takeaways from the recent United Nations COP30 event and explore how these developments intersect with Brazil’s unique environmental landscape.
Panelists will examine Brazil’s growing leadership in sustainable agriculture, the implications of COP30 for global and local produce industries, and how IFPA members can stay ahead of policy, market, and environmental shifts. The discussion will reinforce the powerful narrative that agriculture—particularly in Brazil—is not the cause of climate change, but a vital tool to combat it. Don’t miss this opportunity to align your business with the future of sustainability and climate-smart agriculture.

The challenge: Sustainability is on consumers’ minds, but mixed signals on terminology, safety perceptions and packaging trade offs keep eco friendly produce from fully taking root.
The International Fresh Produce Association surveyed 754 U.S. consumers to explore how sustainability considerations shape produce purchases and to identify actionable strategies that drive both sustainable choices and sales. This section explores local sourcing, packaging impact and eco friendly claims, highlighting opportunities for clear labeling, traceable origin stories and packaging innovation to meet expectations and expand market share.
Sustainability in Mind, But Selectively
Just over half of shoppers consider growing methods and packaging materials when buying produce.
The Opportunity: Elevate clear, certified sustainability claims (organic, recyclable, low pesticide) on front of pack and in store signage.
Local Commands a Premium
Nearly three quarters of consumers are willing to pay more for locally grown produce.
The Opportunity: Spotlight local sourcing through “Farm to Table” labels, regional branding and dedicated shelf sections.
Packaging: Premium vs. Perceived Waste
Almost half of consumers would pay extra for sustainable packaging, yet many still view packaging itself as unnecessary.
The Opportunity: Introduce minimal waste packs that balance protection, and clearly articulate the value of each packaging feature.
Terminology Confusion
Only 20% of Americans understand advanced sustainability terms like carbon farming or climate smart ag—though these buzzwords influence purchase decisions
The Opportunity: Simplify sustainability language with easy scan QR codes, in store info cards and straightforward icons that explain practices in plain English.
Perceived Quality Up
Perceived quality of sustainably produced items has increased in 2024 compared to 2023.
The Opportunity: Spotlight quality, taste, and freshness on packaging of sustainable produced items to further increase consumer preferences for these products.
Quick Wins for Produce Marketers
Launch a “Locally Grown” campaign with premium shelf tags.
Roll out eco minimal packaging piloted in high traffic stores.
Deploy QR codes to educate on sustainability terms.
Feature sustainability “storyboards” in digital ads and social channels.

Procedures for USMCA Covered Items
If your goods meet the USMCA rules of origin, they remain duty-free—but this benefit is not automatic.
Importers must claim preferential treatment based on a certification of origin to avoid tariffs.
Goods that do not meet the rules of origin will not qualify for tariff-free entry.
Products with high amounts of materials from outside North America may not qualify for duty-free status.
Businesses may need to explore alternative sourcing and increase North American content to benefit to qualify for exemption from tariffs.

How to Export Cut Flowers from Mexico to the US

The U.S. is the largest consumer of fresh flowers in the world. If you are interested in exporting cut flowers and/or plants to the U.S. you must understand U.S. requirements and regulations associated with the process, including necessary documentation.
Flowers imported into the U.S. are required to comply with regulations from the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service and Customs and Border Protection. Depending on factors like country of origin, whether the flowers are cut, have berries, and more, you may need an import license. When bringing plants into the U.S., a soilless mix must be used. It is much easier to bring bare root items, tissue cultures and cuttings into the U.S.
The first step is knowing if the genus is allowed in the U.S. If not, you will need to apply for market access with SENASICA in Mexico. To confirm approval there is a searchable database Agricultural Commodity Import Requirements . You will need to look at the Plants and Plant Products Not for Propagation (e.g., cuts) and Plants for Planting and Propagation (e.g., cuttings) sections. That database describes the import requirements for commodities from specific countries for products that already have approval. If your product does not have approval, a market access request is necessary.
Comply With US Import Regulations
The U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP)
This agency is tasked with making sure shipments meet federal guidelines to reach a port of entry along with paying all fees and taxes. When it comes to importing flowers, the CBP inspects flower shipments to certify they are pest-free before clearing the port. CBP ensures each shipment of fresh cut flowers being imported into the U.S. is properly marked with the country of origin.
The U.S. Department of Agriculture/Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (USDA/APHIS)
This agency regulates the importation of fresh cut flowers to be used for decoration or ornamentation. The agency also works to protect plants on the threatened or extinction list under the Plant Protection Act, Endangered Species Act and the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES).
A helpful resource for importing flowers is the Cut Flower and Import Greenery Manual: https://fsvps.gov.ru/fsvps-docs/ru/importExport/usa/files/phyto_usa_flowers_new.pdf The manual covers the guidelines and regulations of fresh, cut sections of the plant which includes the bloom, greenery like leaves, along with the branches, stems and any attached fruit, that is not intended for consumption or growing.
Duties: There are importing requirements that must be met which include paying the taxes and fees assessed to each shipment. These fees are known commonly as import duty or customs duty. The amount of import duty to be paid is determined by the actual value of the goods. Import duty can be found by identifying an item’s HTS code. Getting the help of a Licensed Customs Broker or using a free HTS Code Lookup tool are both ways of ensuring that your HTS codes are correct so that you pay the correct import duty.
Overview of Mexican Agencies Involved in exporting cut flowers and/or plants
If you are exporting cut flowers and/or plants to the U.S. from Mexico, you must understand the Mexican agencies and regulations associated with the process. Here is a high-level summary of Mexican government agencies’ role:
SENASICA
The Service for the National Health for Food Safety and Food Quality (SENASICA) - Servicio Nacional de Sanidad, Inocuidad y Calidad Agroalimentaria protects Mexico's agri-food by preventing the entry of pests and diseases through products of animal, vegetable, aquaculture and fishing origin. Additionally, it regulates and promotes the application and certification of agricultural products to facilitate the vegetal and animal-based domestic and international trade.
SAGARPA
SAGARPA promotes supporting policies to improve production, make better use of the comparative advantages of the agricultural sector, integrate rural environment into the rest of the economy’s productive supply chains, and incite growers’ organizations collaboration within their own programs and projects.
SAT
SAT is responsible for applying the fiscal and customs legislation with the goal that both individuals and companies contribute to public expenses on a proportional and equitable basis, inspect tax payers so they comply with tax and customs provisions; facilitate and encourage voluntary compliance, and generate and provide the necessary information for the design and evaluation of the tax policy.
COFEPRIS
COFEPRIS establishes and implements politics, programs and projects at the level of international best practice, under effective coordination with the different players in the public, private and social sectors, to prevent and assist on sanitary risks, contributing to public health

The FDA’s FSMA 204 Final Food Traceability Rule is in effect now and will start to be enforced on January 20, 2026. This regulation will require all companies across the supply chain, from growers to retailers and foodservice operators, to track and share data that they have never tracked or shared before.
To assist the industry, 5 Produce Traceability Initiative Working Groups created best practices for the fresh produce supply chain to best comply with the new FSMA 204 requirements.
Hear from the industry chairs that led the working groups as they discuss these best practices and offer insight on how companies can become compliant with the new regulations.

IFPA monitors the retail landscape across markets, bringing you the information you need to take advantage of new opportunities for your business. Here, we provide a close look at the relative performance of retailers in key established and growing international markets: Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, France, Germany, India, Italy, Japan, Mexico, UK and USA. Performance metrics include revenue, growth, and the number of outlets for top retailers in each country.
International retail markets are returning to pre-pandemic levels, though retailer marketshare has shifted dramatically within these markets. Companies that readily adapted to meet the needs of consumers during the pandemic have shown significant growth over the last two years, edging out more traditional retailers.
Among the country implications are:
Brazilian consumers are more likely to try new products and services compared to other global consumers.
Indians are more likely to be vegetarian or vegan, compared to the global average.
From 2017-2022, the grocery retail market in Mexico has slowly increased, as a result of grocery stores expanding.
Eating healthy and nutritious foods is still a consumer focus in Germany as a result of the pandemic.
Actively monitoring consumption in order to manage weight is important to Americans.
A quarter of Chinese consumers report that they don't have time to cook.
Japanese consumers report reheating or preparing a ready meal more frequently than other countries.
French consumers report that finding food and drinks with health benefits to be of high importance.
Respondents in the UK cook or bake at home rather than dine out at least weekly more frequently than other countries.
Three quarters of Italian consumers report they prefer home cooked food.
More baby boomers in Canada said they live alone and don’t want to cook for themselves compared to other generations.
In Australia, consumers report that one of the biggest barriers to preparing and cooking food at home is lack of time.

In this member-exclusive content, IFPA provides details of the three consumption channels: retail, food processing and foodservice. IFPA identifies key buyers/importers and main ports while highlighting specific opportunities that Japan offers to the global produce market.
Japan imported $3,374 million fresh produce in 2021, with 2% compound annual growth rate.
Success in Japan is dependent on building relationships with local importers and distributors, focusing on food processing partners and building brand awareness for each importing market.
Japan is largely dependent on importation of fresh fruit and vegetable, especially imports of bananas, avocados, kiwis and pineapples. Although Japan is reliant on imports, the clearance requirements enforced by the Japanese Government makes importing very difficult. The Japanese people prefer locally grown produce over imports, however, the import market is dominated by high value produce from developed countries and markets.

Como exportar frutas y vegetales frescos de Mexico a Estados Unidos
Share

Email
Share
Si está interesado en exportar frutas y vegetales frescos a Estados Unidos, debe conocer todos los requisitos y las reglamentaciones de EE. UU. relacionados con este proceso, incluida la documentación necesaria. La exportación de alimentos es un proceso complicado debido a que estos productos básicos están relacionados directamente con la salud y la inocuidad.
Las frutas y los vegetales frescos que se importan a EE. UU., deben cumplir las mismas reglamentaciones que aquellos que se producen en EE. UU., además de que los productos deben ser inocuos y no contener ingredientes prohibidos. El etiquetado y el envasado también son componentes críticos.
La exportación es un proceso complicado; es mejor trabajar con un intermediario
No se puede dejar de insistir en la importancia de comprender y cumplir las leyes, las reglamentaciones y los requisitos de importación. Los exportadores mexicanos pueden considerar obtener orientación de expertos del sector privado que se especializan en importar frutas y vegetales frescos a EE. UU., por ejemplo, agentes de aduanas (declarantes de entradas), abogados o asesores autorizados. Los agentes de aduanas son las únicas personas autorizados por las leyes arancelarias de los Estados Unidos para actuar como agentes de los exportadores mexicanos en la transacción de sus negocios aduaneros. Los agentes de aduanas son las únicas personas privadas o firmas que están autorizados por la Oficina de Aduanas y Protección Fronteriza de EE. UU. (CBP, por sus siglas en inglés) para preparar y presentar las entradas de aduanas necesarias, preparar el pago de las obligaciones, tomar medidas para efectuar la liberación de los productos en custodia de la CBP y de otra forma representar a sus clientes en asuntos aduaneros.
Aspectos generales de las agencias estadounidenses que intervienen en la importación de frutas y vegetales a los Estados Unidos
Hay tres entidades gubernamentales estadounidenses que intervienen en la importación de frutas y vegetales a los Estados Unidos:
Departamento de Agricultura de los Estados Unidos (USDA, por sus siglas en inglés)
Servicio de Inspección Sanitaria de Animales y Plantas (APHIS, por sus siglas en inglés)
Servicio de Comercialización Agrícola (AMS, por sus siglas en inglés)
Administración de Alimentos y Medicamentos de EE. UU. (FDA, por sus siglas en inglés)
Oficina de Aduanas y Protección Fronteriza de EE. UU. (CBP, por sus siglas en inglés)
El Servicio de Inspección Sanitaria de Animales y Plantas (APHIS) del Departamento de Agricultura de los Estados Unidos y la Administración de Alimentos y Medicamentos de EE. UU. (FDA) determinan la admisibilidad de los diferentes productos alimenticios que se importan a los Estados Unidos. La CBP se encarga del cumplimiento de las reglamentaciones del APHIS en los puertos de ingreso. Los especialistas agrícolas de la CBP inspeccionan los envíos de productos importados y se aseguran de que cada envío esté acompañado de los permisos y los certificados fitosanitarios (para productos vegetales) exigidos.El AMS de la USDA se encarga del cumplimiento de las órdenes de comercialización federales de frutas, vegetales y cultivos especiales, así como del cumplimiento de las reglamentaciones de importación, incluidos los requisitos de etiquetado. Las leyes exigen que las importaciones a los Estados Unidos de frutas, vegetales y cultivos especiales específicos cumplan las mismas normas, o normas similares, en cuanto a la clasificación, el tamaño, la calidad y el grado de madurez que los productos nacionales cubiertos por las órdenes de comercialización federales. Cómo determinar si puede exportar sus frutas y vegetales a EE. UU.El APHIS se asegura de que todos los productos agrícolas importados que se envían a los Estados Unidos desde el extranjero cumplan los requisitos de ingreso de la agencia para evitar plagas y enfermedades agrícolas.
Si desea exportar frutas y vegetales frescos para consumo, primero verifique la base de datos de los Requisitos de Importación de Frutas y Vegetales (FAVIR, por sus siglas en inglés) para conocer cuáles frutas y vegetales se permiten por producto básico o por país. También le proporciona los requisitos generales para la exportación a los Estados Unidos, como los tratamientos que se exigen, las inspecciones especiales, el estado del despacho previo o los puertos de llegada autorizados. Para exportar frutas y vegetales extranjeros, en primer lugar debe solicitar un permiso de importación agrícola del APHIS y obtener un certificado fitosanitario del país exportador.Se anexa una ficha del APHIS: Importación de alimentos y productos agrícolas a los Estados Unidos en español. Aspectos generales de los requisitos de la FDA
En virtud de las disposiciones de las leyes estadounidenses contenidas en la Ley Federal de Alimentos, Medicamentos y Cosméticos de EE. UU., los importadores de productos alimenticios, incluidas las frutas y los vegetales, son responsables de asegurarse de que los productos sean inocuos, sanitarios y que estén etiquetados de acuerdo con los requisitos de EE. UU. Los exportadores y/o importadores de frutas y vegetales se deben registrar ante la FDA. Todos los productos alimenticios comerciales están sujetos a la presentación de la notificación previa en la FDA.Las frutas y los vegetales importados están sujetos a la inspección de la FDA al momento de la llegada a los puertos de ingreso. La FDA puede detener los embarques de productos si se observa que no cumplen con los requisitos de EE. UU.Haga clic aquí para ver información adicional acerca del programa de importaciones a EE. UU. de la FDA.  Aspectos generales de los requisitos de la CBPLa CBP se encarga del cumplimiento de los requisitos establecidos por el APHIS y la FDA para permitir el ingreso de frutas y vegetales a EE. UU.
La CBP libera los envíos de alimentos solo cuando obtiene prueba satisfactoria de que se ha presentado a la FDA la notificación previa (PN, por sus siglas en inglés). Por lo tanto, es de vital importancia que el número de acreditación de la PN se envíe a la CBP junto con los documentos de entrada. El número de acreditación de la PN se debe anotar en los documentos de envío (es decir, en el conocimiento de embarque o la guía aérea).
Además del requisito de la PN, una vez que los productos llegan a EE. UU., la FDA puede tomar una muestra o comunicarle a la CBP que continúe con la liberación del envío. Si una muestra viola las reglamentaciones de la FDA, recibirá una notificación de incautación de la FDA. Para ver el estado de los alimentos incautados por la FDA, llame al número que se menciona en el aviso de incautación o al número principal de Operaciones y Políticas de Importación al (301) 443-6553.
Se anexa la guía de la CBP: Importación a los Estados Unidos: guía para importadores comerciales  Aspectos generales de los requisitos del AMS de la USDA
Es responsabilidad del importador registrado hacer que cada lote (envío) importado sea inspeccionado por el AMS en cuanto a la clasificación y la calidad. Se define al importador como la parte responsable de despachar los productos por las aduanas, y podría ser el transportista, el destinatario o un tercero como un intermediario o un abogado apoderado.
A partir del 1 de septiembre de 2016, todas las frutas y los vegetales importados sujetos a la reglamentación del AMS se deben presentar para la inspección del AMS o sus asociados federales o estatales como lotes individuales que corresponden a cada número de entrada de aduanas individual.
Aquí puede encontrar más información acerca de los requisitos de importación del AMS de la USDA
Consideraciones adicionales para los exportadores mexicanos de frutas y vegetales frescos
Aunque la información presentada aquí ofrece un resumen general de las agencias con las que un exportador mexicano podría trabajar, hay muchos otros detalles, reglamentaciones y trámites necesarios para el cumplimiento. Es mejor trabajar con un intermediario.
Además, este documento señala las reglamentaciones formales necesarias para exportar frutas y vegetales a los Estados Unidos; sin embargo, pueden existir otros requisitos específicos para los compradores estadounidenses, como las certificaciones de inocuidad alimenticia, el etiquetado o el envasado. Aspectos generales de las agencias mexicanas que participan en la exportación de frutas y vegetales desde México
Si usted exporta frutas y vegetales a EE. UU. desde México, debe conocer las agencias y las reglamentaciones de México relacionados con el proceso. Se presente aquíun resumen general del papel de las agencias gubernamentales de México:

If you are interested in exporting fruits and vegetables to the U.S., you must understand all U.S. requirements and regulations associated with the process, including necessary documentation. Exporting food is a complicated process due to the fact that these commodities are directly related to public health and safety.
Fruits and vegetables imported into the U.S. must meet the same regulations as produce produced in the U.S., and products must be safe and contain no prohibited ingredients. Labeling and packaging are also critical components.
Exporting is complicated – work with a broker
The importance of understanding and complying with importing laws, regulations and requirements cannot be overemphasized. Mexican exporters may wish to obtain guidance from private-sector experts who specialize in importing produce into the U.S. , for example, licensed customs brokers (entry filer), attorneys or consultants. Customs brokers are the only persons authorized by the tariff laws of the United States to act as agents for Mexican exporters in the transaction of their customs business. Customs brokers are private individuals or firms licensed by U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) to prepare and file the necessary customs entries, arrange for the payment of duties, take steps to effect the release of the goods in CBP custody, and otherwise represent their principals in customs matters.
Overview of U.S. Agencies Involved in Importing Fruits and Vegetables into the US
There are three U.S. government entities involved in the import of fruits and vegetables into the U.S.:
U.S. Department of Agricultural
Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS)
Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS)
U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)
U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP)
The U. S. Department of Agriculture Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) and U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) determine the admissibility of various food products imported into the United States. The CBP enforces APHIS regulations at ports of entry. CBP agriculture specialists inspect shipments of imported products and ensure that the required permits and phytosanitary certificates (for plant products) accompany each shipment.USDA’s AMS enforces the federal marketing orders for fruits, vegetables, and specialty crops, as well as compliance with import regulations, including labeling requirements. Laws require specific fruit, vegetable, and specialty crop imports into the United States to meet the same or comparable grade, size, quality and maturity standards as domestic products covered by federal marketing orders.
How to determine if you can export your fruit and vegetable to the U.S.APHIS makes sure that all imported agricultural products shipped to the United States from abroad meet the agency's entry requirements to exclude pests and diseases of agriculture.If you want to export fresh fruits and vegetables for consumption, first check the Fruits and Vegetables Import Requirements (FAVIR) database to understand which fruits and vegetables by commodity or country are allowed. This also gives you the general requirements for their exportation to the United States, such as required treatments, special inspections, preclearance status, and/or approved arrival ports.
To export foreign fruits and vegetables, you must apply for an agricultural import permit from APHIS and obtain a phytosanitary certificate from the exporting country.
Attached is an APHIS Factsheet: Importing Food and Agricultural Products into the United States in Spanish.Overview of FDA requirements
Under provisions of U.S. law contained in the U.S. Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, importers of food products, including fruits and vegetables, are responsible for ensuring that the products are safe, sanitary, and labeled according to U.S. requirements.
Exporters and/or importers of fruits and vegetables must register with FDA. All commercial food products are subject to prior notice filing with FDA.Imported fruits and vegetables are subject to FDA inspection upon arrival at U.S. ports of entry. FDA may detain shipments of products if they are found not to be in compliance with U.S. requirements.Overview of CBP requirements
CBP enforces the requirements set forth from APHIS and the FDA to allow fruits and vegetables to enter the U.S.
CBP will not release food shipments without proof that prior notice (PN) has been filed with FDA. Therefore, it is imperative that the PN satisfied number is submitted to CBP along with the entry documents. The PN satisfied number should be annotated on the shipping documents (i.e. bill of lading or airway bill).
In addition to the PN requirement, once the goods arrive in the U.S., FDA may collect a sample or tell CBP to proceed with releasing the shipment. If a sample is in violation of FDA regulations, you will receive a Notice of Detention from FDA. To find out the status of food that has been detained by FDA, call the number referenced on the detention notice or the main number for Import Operations and Policy at (301) 443-6553.
View the CBP's Guide: Importing into the United States A Guide for Commercial ImportersOverview of USDA AMS Requirements
It is the responsibility of the importer of record to have each imported lot (shipment) inspected for grade and quality by AMS. The importer is defined as the party responsible for clearing the goods through customs and could be the shipper, the receiver, or a third party such as a broker or attorney of record.
As of September 1, 2016, all imported fruit and vegetables subject to AMS regulation must be presented for inspection to AMS or its Federal-State partners as separate lots that correspond to each individual Customs Entry Number.

Other considerations for Mexican fresh produce exporters
While the information presented here provides a high-level summary of agencies a Mexican exporter may need to work with, there are many other details, regulations and paperwork needed for compliance. It is best to work with a broker.
Additionally, this document notes formal regulations necessary for exporting fruits and vegetables to the U.S. However, there may be additional requirements specific to U.S. buyers, such as food safety certifications, labeling or packaging.Overview of Mexican Agencies Involved in Exporting Fruits and Vegetables from Mexico
If you are exporting fruits and vegetables to the U.S. from Mexico, you must understand the Mexican agencies and regulations associated with the process. Here is a high-level summary of Mexican government agencies’ role:
SENASICA
SENASICA protects agriculture, water and livestock resources from economic and quarantine importance pests and diseases. Additionally, it regulates and promotes the application and certification of the food contamination risk reduction systems and its agri-food quality to facilitate the vegetal and animal-based domestic and international trade.
SAGARPA
SAGARPA promotes supporting policies to improve production, make better use of the comparative advantages of the agricultural sector, integrate rural environment into the rest of the economy’s productive supply chains, and incite growers’ organizations collaboration within their own programs and projects.

The European Green Deal: Overview and Implications for Produce
Share

The European Green Deal is a Europe’s economic, social, and environmental growth strategy moving forward. The European Commission is committed to supporting this strategy through transformative policies and direct investment. If you do business in the EU, or have European business partners, this will affect your organization over the coming years. Here, we bring you the basics of what the Green Deal is and start to unpack what this will mean for our industry both in Europe and around the world.Motivated by the social, economic, and environmental consequences of global climate change, the Green Deal strives to achieve one landmark goal: to be completely carbon neutral by the year 2050. Moreover, they commit to achieving this goal while at the same time both breaking the link between economic growth and resource use, and ensure that all no one is left behind. This is a completely radical ambition, not just paying lip service to sustainability but making it the star of the show for the largest trade block in the world.
Under the Green Deal, the commission has been and will continue to roll out relevant policy. The following are the identified policy areas, and how they connect to our industry.
Policy Areas:
BiodiversityThe produce industry is, of course, dependent on plant crops, all of which are derived from naturally occurring species that have been brought into cultivation. Maintaining biodiversity on our planet provides sources for diversity in our products.
Farm to ForkThe produce supply chain will be directly affected by new policies that address how food moves from the field to consumers.
Sustainable AgricultureGrowers will need to adapt their farming practice to be in compliance.
Clean EnergyThe exact implementation is to be determined, but this policy area will likely have a more diffuse affect on the produce industry.
Sustainable IndustryProcessing and packaging operations will be affected under this policy area, as the Green Deal champions environmentally friendly production techniques and facilities.
Building and RenovatingProduce will be tangentially affected here as shippers, warehouses, and processors upgrade or build new facilities.
Sustainable MobilityTo achieve net carbon neutrality, the Green Deal scrutinizes many sources of greenhouse gas emissions, including transportation. Shippers in the produce industry will be directly affected by this policy area.
Climate ActionThis is the direct goal of getting the EU to a point of carbon neutrality by 2050. This broad area can cover any point source of greenhouse gas emissions not directly addressed above.
The EU Green Deal is revolutionary and vast in its scope.  Any single major policy shift will have a broad reaching ripple effect throughout an industry, and here we are looking at multiple policy areas. Luckily, we have the gift of time when it comes to the Green Deal: by unveiling the vision of this before the policies all go into effect, our industry has time to anticipate and invest to succeed because of, rather than in spite of, these changes.
We can look at the Green Deal as an opportunity to invest and make our businesses more sustainable on a level playing field. Rather than having to consider whether an investment into sustainability will make your business less competitive, remember that most of your peers will have to make those same investments to maintain access to the European market. This has two effects. First, eco-friendly products will become more affordable to you. We have seen this very clearly throughout history: as expensive new technology becomes widely adopted, it becomes cheaper. Here, the Green Deal will essentially force the adoption of new technologies to achieve sustainability goals, and the cost to make your business more sustainable will decrease as a result. Second, the entire industry will be investing and making changes in their businesses to meet the Green Deal policy requirements. While there is a concern that these efforts will cut into margins, remember that it will do so for your competitors as well.
In many ways, the Green Deal reflects values that we already hold dear: access to fresh, healthy food that nourishes our global population. As the EU Green Deal unfolds in a series of policy changes, we are here to support our members as you navigate these changes and maximize the benefits for your businesses. The power of the EU is that the scale of this initiative will likely lead the global industry towards a greener world. As companies change how they do business and make the investments necessary to enter the European market, they will inevitably become more competitive in other markets because of the higher quality of their products and higher social standards under which they do business. The EU has taken a stance, and the world of fresh will follow.

Indonesia, the Philippines and Thailand are the key fresh fruit producers in Southeast Asia. The region primarily exports fresh fruit, which has increased over the last three years, but overall the region remains a net fresh produce importer.
This article details Southeast Asia's role in global fresh produce production and the key countries producing, importing and exporting in the region.
Fresh Produce Trade
Southeast Asia produces approximately 7 percent share of global fresh produce quantity and production has grown 3 percent over the three-year period of 2011-2013. Indonesia, the Philippines and Thailand are the key fresh fruit producers in this region. In addition to its production, the region is a net fresh produce importer.
Exports
The region primarily exports fresh fruit — accounting for a 4 percent share of global fresh fruit export value. The Philippines, Thailand and Vietnam are the leading exporters in the region.
Exports are increasing. Southeastern Asia’s fresh fruit exports averaged annual increases of more than 30 percent between 2010 and 2013, outpacing the global fresh fruit export growth rate of an average 20 percent.
Imports
Southeast Asia is a net fresh produce importer, and accounts for a 4 percent share of global fresh produce imports. Fruit imports are growing — on average 20 percent annually in the last three years. Apples, other fresh fruits, citrus and grapes are the top fresh fruits imported. Apple, grape and mango imports are driving growth.
Indonesia, the Philippines and Vietnam are among leading growth markets for fresh food globally, posting double digit consumption growth between 2010 and 2015. For fresh produce specifically, Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand and Singapore are the key import markets in Southeastern Asia.
Trade
ASEAN currently has six key Free Trade Agreements (FTA) with Australia, China, India, Japan, New Zealand, and South Korea. And there is talk of creating a single FTA between these six countries and ASEAN, a more interconnected trade deal within a trade deal (Euromonitor). In addition, ASEAN is currently negotiating a free trade agreement with the EU.
ASEAN members including Brunei, Malaysia, Singapore and Vietnam are also currently part of negotiations for the Trans Pacific Partnership (TPP), the largest trade deal to be negotiated to date, and will liberalize trade among economies in the Asia Pacific and Americas regions.
Opportunities & Challenges for Fresh Produce in Southeast Asia
Southeast Asia’s strong economic performance and forecasted growth will continue to drive development in the region. Increased urbanization and a youthful population with increasing purchasing power will fuel this growth.
Although much of its current trade is concentrated in the Asia Pacific region (China, Japan, etc.), Southeast Asia is positioned to diversify its trade base with the impending Trans Pacific Partnership (TPP) Trade Agreement which could broaden trade in the Pacific Rim with the Americas. The TPP will create first-time trade deals among many of the countries involved in the negotiations. Malaysia and Vietnam have had no prior trade deals with the U.S., Mexico or Peru. Reduced or eliminated tariffs are expected for the trade of agricultural products.
Additionally, through the ASEAN integration, the goal of creating a single market of more than 600 million consumers will be realized along with their manufacturing and services industries streamline trade flowing to and from the region.
Insufficient infrastructure, higher unemployment among the youth, and known corruption affecting many of the countries in the region could hinder foreign investment and development. Additionally, the region is prone to floods, which could impact infrastructure development and agricultural production.

According to The Economist, the growing populations of Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the UAE, also called the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC), point to increased dependence on imported food staples. Food imports are projected to grow to US$53.1 billion by 2020. Major factors driving the GCC market include growing domestic and expat population, rising health consciousness among the population, changing tastes and preferences, and growing disposable income leading to higher consumption of nutritional foods as part of a stable diet.
The United Nations’ figures reveal the population of GCC countries jumped by 18.9 percent in the last five years. In countries like Saudi Arabia the birth rate has topped 20 percent consistently in recent years. According to a report published by the Economist Intelligence Unit, by 2020 the GCC population is forecast to reach 53.5m, a 30 percent increase over the level in 2000.
IFPA reports that consumers with changing tastes are willing to pay a premium for an assortment of produce offering freshness, quality, flavor, safety and convenience. “Young and affluent Western food-loving consumers are driving the growth and demand for imported goods and foods in the Middle East,” states an analyst from Mintel. In addition, there are healthy eating efforts toward purchasing more fruits and vegetables. Falling groundwater and aquifer levels in the Arabian Peninsula, limited rainfall, arid climate, overreliance on imports and rising soil salinity are affecting the fruits and vegetables market. The region’s dependence on desalinated water means that meeting more of its food needs through domestic production is not an option in the long term.
Key import markets in the Middle East
Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Kuwait and Egypt are the largest markets for fresh produce imports. Saudi Arabia and the UAE account for over 2 percent of global fresh produce imports, and Saudi Arabia fresh produce imports are growing at a faster rate than global imports in the last five years.
Top items imported
Citrus and berries are sizeable categories growing in the last three years. Berries increased +8% CAGR from 2014 through 2016.
Who supplies the growing import markets in the Middle East?
In total, the Middle East is a net fresh produce exporter. About 40 percent of the Middle East’s fresh produce imports are supplied by other Middle Eastern countries, with Egypt and Turkey being the two largest suppliers. But various other countries supply the rest.
The growing markets for fresh produce in Saudi Arabia, UAE and Kuwait have increased supply from various countries including South Africa, Europe, Latin America, and the Asia Pacific region, including Australia and India.

Speakers
Scott Howarth: LinkedIn | Sinclair
Rod Baeini: LinkedIn | Accu-Label
Today we are talking about PLU stickers—those tiny, ubiquitous labels on our fruits and vegetables. For those in the produce industry, they are well-known, but for others, PLU stickers ensure pricing accuracy for loose produce in supermarkets. Each sticker boasts a Price Look Up (PLU) code, a cashier's tool for identifying products quickly. Recently, PLU stickers have taken the spotlight as certain European countries push for the mandate that these stickers on fresh produce must be home-compostable, sparking discussions and concerns, especially in the USA regarding potential export challenges if other nations follow suit. Joining us to break down this topic are industry experts Rod Baeini, General Manager at Accu-Label International, and Scott Howarth, Director of Research and Development at Sinclair.
In this episode, Rod and Scott shed light on the origins of PLU stickers, their presence in the industry, and the intricate process of obtaining a PLU code. We explore how PLU stickers can help consumers identify organic produce and the wealth of information they contain. You will learn about the future of PLU stickers, the ongoing challenges driven by evolving regulations, and the complexities surrounding home composability.
KEY TAKEAWAYS
Why PLU stickers were created.
How long PLU stickers have been around.
The amount of information on PLUs.
The benefit of having PLUs on products.
What Rod and Scott see for the future of PLU stickers.
The definition of home compostable.
Ideas Worth Sharing
“There is a lot of information that can be put on PLUs. I think the next phase of the PLU may even be QR codes, and when we get to that step, we will have more information on the PLU. People will be able to scan it and get more out of it.” - Rod Baeini
“When it comes to PLUs we think we are getting there and then the regulations change. A lot of that has to do with there not being a standard legislation across the globe. Every single country and every single region is coming up with their own mandates and we’re all trying to react to those right now.” - Rod Baeini
“People don’t realize how QR codes on PLU stickers will help them at the point of sale. It is also the minimalist amount of packaging you can have. So, if you’re really concerned about being sustainable, these little PLUs take up so few resources but do such a big job for the industry.” - Scott Howarth

Adam Hollowell
Bryant Christie Inc.
Welcome to the inaugural episode of a six-part season that sheds light on the crucial intersection of packaging practices within the produce industry and the pressing imperative for sustainability. Join us on this journey as we navigate the intricate balance between delivering high-quality, pathogen-free products and minimizing the environmental impact caused by packaging waste. In this season, we will talk with experts who are pioneering innovative packaging methods, waste reduction strategies, and sustainable practices within the produce sector. We will also dissect the complexities of proposed regulations advocating for reduced packaging, discussing potential repercussions on produce quality, post-harvest losses, and environmental conservation.
Today Adam Hollowell, Senior Trade Policy Specialist at Bryant Christie Inc, will explain international policy initiatives related to fresh produce packaging, regional variations in these policies, the impact of new packaging regulations on produce-exporting companies, regional responses to policy changes, and proactive steps to support future policy adjustments. As we delve into these topics, we will confront the challenges associated with the cost and feasibility of packaging alternatives for producers and the importance of ensuring that these transitions do not impact trade or exclude smaller producers from the market. Listen in as we explore how policymakers can balance trade interests with sustainability objectives.
KEY TAKEAWAYS
The current issues faced in the produce sector as it relates to packaging.
The notable policy initiatives in packaging for fresh produce on an international scale.
How new policy changes to packaging impact companies growing produce for export.
How different regions are responding to these policy changes.
Why the cost is such a big issue for those hoping to make packaging changes.
The challenge between food safety and sustainable packaging.
How policymakers can strike a balance between trade interest and sustainability.
Ideas Worth Sharing
“The cost and viability of some of these alternatives is challenging for a lot of producers. So, although we have seen some progress, there is a long way to go before we even begin to have these conversations about reducing packaging for fresh produce and making sure alternatives are available.” - Adam Hollowell
“There is a long way to go to make sure that the produce sector is supported to revolutionize and adjust its packaging supply chains to meet the growing demands that we will see.” - Adam Hollowell
“What we don’t want is this to become another barrier to trade. The larger producers may have the resources to manage that transition, but it’s the smaller producers that will be shut out of these markets and that is what we need to avoid at all costs.” - Adam Hollowell

Cybersecurity in the Fresh Produce Industry

Cybersecurity works to protect and prevent industry members from cyberattacks. Cybercrime has the potential to stop production, leak information, cost large amounts of money and negatively affect business. Some ways to improve cybersecurity and make produce industry suppliers safe from attack are transparency, planning, training, sharing data and improving practices. Cybersecurity is important in industry and food supply, according to the “IFPA Takes on Tech” podcast. In today’s world, every company uses technology and needs to take protective and preventative measures. Greg Gatzke, president of ZAGtech, explains some of the ways companies can be attacked, including compromised emails, bank fraud and CryptoLocker attack, which involves hackers gaining access into the private environment, sharing information and locking machines used for processing. Cryptolocking can halt processing for days or even weeks. If not caught within 24 hours, it is harder to fix and more business is lost. Another example of a cybersecurity issue is attackers holding supply chain information for ransom and demanding large sums of money to release the information back to respective companies. These are just some of the reasons the agriculture industry must implement systems to formulate a plan to prevent attacks. Although cybersecurity is growing in the industry and has been a developing point of interest, there is still a stigma behind “cybershaming” and embarrasement to come forward and talk about an attack. It is crucial for individuals to share data, experiences and threats in order to minimize the possibility of cybercrime for others. Spreading knowledge, being transparent and collaborating with other industry members are helpful ways to solve cyber security breaches and problems.

Building on the success of last year’s inaugural class, the Fresh Field Catalyst technology accelerator program is now recruiting its next cohort.
Right now, the produce and floral industries face numerous problems, including water and resource scarcity, the impacts of climate change and ongoing labor shortages. All of these issues disrupt supply chains, impact farmers’ livelihoods and ultimately threaten global food security.
The Fresh Field Catalyst program seeks innovative companies with solutions for these problems and others, specifically as they relate to the produce and floral industries.
Companies from multiple areas are invited to apply, including those in the plant nutrition/inputs space, those developing crop genetics and resiliency technologies, and startups making tools for reducing emissions and enabling climate-smart agriculture (irrigation, inputs, on-farm robotics, support systems for traceability, verification and marketing of climate-smart commodities). Companies developing technologies for reducing post-harvest losses and waste are also encouraged to apply.
The program aims to bridge the gap between technology development and farm-level impacts by accelerating the adoption of climate-smart practices. Companies in the late stages of trialing or operating in at least one market are eligible to apply, with products in any market outside agriculture or in row crops and/or the produce industry outside the US. The program is designed for companies that are ready to launch and which can generate revenue and scale in the produce market within two years with climate-smart products.
The six-month program will deeply immerse participants in the produce industry, with a week of field and company visits, bi-weekly virtual meet-ups with experts, mentoring from senior leaders in the industry, and a stand at the IFPA Global Show in Anaheim, California. The program is a unique opportunity for companies to gain insights into the challenges of the produce industry and contribute to the fight against climate change through technology.
The 2022 cohort of 12 companies included produce quality control startup Clarifruit, supply chain startup DiMuto and greenhouse grower Netled. These companies and others achieved great positive results from participating in the program, including an article in Farm Progress, credibility when applying for EU grants, development of new products, acquisition of new customers, improved go-to-market strategies, new grant opportunities, pilot testing programs, and networking with key industry players. Additionally, a participant received a $1 million grant from the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) to further optimize the technology and another started a new project leading to new IP.
“IFPA’s Fresh Field Catalyst give us a great perspective and brought real, tangible relationships with some of the leading players in the fresh produce supply chain.” – Elad Mardix, co-founder & CEO, Clarifruit
“This is what we’ve been waiting for. It really is the opportunity to accelerate the process of getting integrated into a new market.” – Kasey Snyder, sales operations manager, Netled
“As a startup, if you don’t have those relationships and that network, it can take you years to really establish. In the Fresh Field Catalyst program, in a week, you get all of this condensed information.” Julie Escobar, chief commercial officer, DiMuto
Applications for the Fresh Field Catalyst are open until March 20, 2023. Apply here.

Live from IFPA’s Global Show: Technology’s Critical Role in Local Produce and Controlled Environment Farming
A very special live podcast from IFPA’s 2022 Floral and Produce show!
We are talking with Craig Hurlbert (CEO) and Dave Vosburg (Chief Innovation Officer) of Local Bounti, John Purcell (Chief Strategy Officer) of Unfold, and Ali Daniali (CEO/Founder) of HRVSTS.
Join us as we discuss:
Networking at a global level at the IFPA’s Floral and Produce Show.
Growing customer demand for locally grown produce
Sustainability in the food system.
The challenges and possibilities of controlled environment farming.
Using Data to inform growing operations.
Segment 1 - Craig Hurlbert (CEO) and Dave Vosburg (Chief Innovation Officer) of Local Bounti
“Controlled environment food growing is very capital intensive, so this model will require management to have a strong understanding of running capital intensive operations.""
Craig Hurlbert
CEO
Local Bounti
Local Bounti is an indoor farming company with an aggressive growth plan over the next five years to deliver delicious, great texture, flavorful products to their customers all across the United States, locally grown.
The demand for locally grown produce is there, the logistics and infrastructure is evolving. People want convenience, less shelf time, flavor, and low price points. Salad kits are a good example of a winning product right now.
Local Bounti is expanding to Texas and Oregon and looking into acquiring other facilities as well.
Segment 2 - John Purcell (Chief Strategy Officer) of Unfold
""Controlled environment [farming] is a confluence of amazing technologies; I like to describe it as Silicon Valley meets Salinas Valley.”
John Purcell
Chief Strategy Officer
Unfold
According to John, this industry is a huge mashup of many sectors in tech, “a confluence of technologies.”
People are drawn to this work because they want to use their skills on something that matters. The reason they get attracted to this is because of the work done producing food in a way better for the planet.
It's new in some ways, but in some ways, it's not. There's a cross fertilization of ideas and technologies from outdoor crop growing and indoor crop growing happening all the time these days.
John suggests we look at the technologies that are out there, and let's figure out how to apply them.
Segment 3 - Ali Daniali (CEO/Founder) of HRVSTS
“We've flipped the equation. For growers, it's actually a push versus pull type of equation, where the buyer is actually telling the grower what to grow”
Ali Daniali
CEO / Founder
HRVSTS
HRVSTS grows and sells specialty produce to food service companies. Using data they can get specialty leafy greens from seed to customer in 7 weeks or less, depending on the crop.
They use data to eliminate the inefficiencies in the system and also contract with small growers and help new farmers get online quickly.

A very special live podcast from IFPA’s 2022 Floral and Produce show!
We close out our season on nutrition with a panel of experts with Vonnie on the lasting impact technology has made and continues to grow on for the farming and fresh produce industries.
Our panel includes Haven Baker, CBO at Pairwise, Jenny Du, Senior Vice President for Government Affairs at Apeel Sciences and Katie Seawell, Chief Commercial Office at Bowery Farming.
Join us as we discuss:
How technology can impact improving accessibility and lifespan of fresh produce
Helping set up for the next wave of entrepreneurs in the health and food industry
Improving access to produce to all communities
How younger generations are creating higher demand for fresh produce
How technology can impact improving accessibility and lifespan of fresh produce
The US has a fresh produce problem — only 1 in 10 Americans are currently hitting their daily intake of fresh fruits and vegetables. While it’s easy to suggest we, as the individual collective, need to make more of an effort to buy produce, the current system is set up in opposition to that goal.
The consistency just isn’t there.
If someone buys a pack of strawberries and they rot before they have time to eat them, it not only impacts the individual’s perception of consuming that fruit, but also their future buying decisions. No one wants to buy a product that continually comes with such a high risk factor.
Fortunately, the new technology that Haven, Jenny and Katie are working on enables less compromise for the consumer; particularly around unlocking nutrition.
""“If we're doing all of this and the flavors are not better, the food's not safer, and we're not enhancing the nutritional value, then it's for naught.”
Katie Seawell
Chief Commercial Officer
Bowery Farming
There’s no silver bullet approach to getting Americans to eat fresh produce again. Fortunately, different companies are all taking different angles to this issue — a crucial step as resources continue to get more scarce.
Katie explains, “We're going to have to feed more people more nutritious food with fewer resources. And I think each of these companies are playing a role in that ecosystem that will emerge in terms of transformation.”
Helping set up for the next wave of entrepreneurs in the health and food industry
For those that want to get involved in this food, health, nutrition nexus, ready to start a company, the three share their best advice:
Katie: You can get through the good days and bad days as long as you commit to your mission, connection and passion along your workplace journey. Building a company is not for the faint of heart but is incredibly rewarding for those who pursue it.
Jenny: Because of how incredibly difficult it is to penetrate the produce space, commitment to mission will be the difference between success and failure. Jenny echoes Katie’s sentiment that the pursuit is 100% worth your effort.
Haven: The first piece of advice is around timing: Through the current macroeconomic uncertainty, it’s important to focus on a revenue generating idea rather than a research idea. Second, make it a priority to get the right people into the right seats early on. If you choose poorly, you could spend months backfilling a position you desperately need.
Improving access to produce to all communities
Jenny emphasizes while it’s encouraging to see all the new offerings, there’s still an issue of access for everyone.
If our current selection of fresh produce can’t find a home, even if it doesn’t meet every specification that technology will eventually enable, we run into environmental issues in the short term.
As recent as 6 years ago, conversations around issues of food waste were not being had. Now, while it’s still very difficult to influence what happens with food by the time it reaches the consumer, efforts are being made to make sure waste doesn’t happen through the supply chain.
How younger generations are creating higher demand for fresh produce
Younger generations are breathing hope into the fresh produce system — and it stems from their expectations around the combination of health and technology. While previous generations may have had some interest in health, a fear of technology has stifled the public’s acceptance of new produce.
""You want folks to know the supply chain super well, but who are also open to seeing it being structured differently from how it is today.”
Jenny Du
Senior Vice President for Government Affairs
Apeel Sciences
Referring to GMOs, Jenny explains, “You have these really great technologies that can help us transform the food system and also meet the needs and the challenges we have. But depending on the approach and the way things just took off at the outset, it put these barriers up.”
With the expectation shift, produce can freely innovate in a way it never could before.

Sponsored by:
We’ve entered into a new era of agricultural production.
Thanks to innovations in biotechnology, exciting new produce varieties are poised to take the market by storm — and get there cheaper and faster than ever before due to relaxing USDA regulations.
And the hottest item in today’s produce expansion?
The purple tomato!
That’s right, thanks to Nathan Pumplin, President and CEO at Norfolk Health Produce, the aesthetically pleasing and nutrient-packed purple tomato is set to hit grocery store shelves as early as 2023.
In our latest episode, Nathan explains:
The health benefits of the purple tomato
The new era of produce and biotechnology
The evolving conversation on GMOs and the future of biotech-driven produce
Purple power
People may argue incessantly over what the best diet is — and fads are always coming and going — but one thing very few people disagree with is that any healthy diet will be one containing plenty of fresh fruits and vegetables. This is especially true when that fresh produce is as diverse as possible.
To achieve that diversity, many — including Nathan — suggest “eating the rainbow” (not to be confused with the slogan for a popular sugary snack, of course).
Eating the rainbow means incorporating fresh fruits and vegetables in every conceivable color. This is important because many of the most desirable vitamins and minerals impact the coloration of produce.
Carrots are orange due to beta carotene. Red coloration in produce is often an indication it contains lycopene.
And purple?
That’s the color of anthocyanins.
""What is special about our tomato is that it's high in antioxidants called anthocyanins.""
Nathan Pumplin
President and CEO
Norfolk Health Produce
You can find anthocyanins in blueberries, blackberries and cherries. A diet rich in this antioxidant has been linked with improved respiratory and cardiovascular health, among other health benefits.
A while back, a professor in the UK named Cathie Martin identified the genes in snapdragons that cause some varieties to present with the tell-tale purple hue signaling they contain this powerful antioxidant. From there, she was able to breed snapdragons containing anthocyanins in far greater quantities than what would typically be found in the plant.
Cathie published the paper that would lay the groundwork for the strikingly beautiful purple tomato some 15 years ago.
So why did it take so long?
The new era
At Norfolk Plant Sciences, Nathan and his colleagues love to stay at the forefront of agricultural innovation. They love nothing more than to seek out the latest science in the sector and find a way to bridge the gap between the lab and the market.
So, their enthusiasm for Cathie’s research — and the opportunity to expand upon it — hardly comes as a surprise. But until recently, getting the antioxidant-rich purple tomato they developed from it to market was a nearly impossible task.
Last year, that all changed.
Where once the USDA’s regulations for biotechnology meant getting a new product to market took a decade and upwards of $100 million, the organization has now relaxed their rules. After years of research, the government body better understands the risks of GMO products and has made a much cheaper and simpler path to market — without jeopardizing safety,
And for organizations like Norfolk Plant Sciences, that’s great news. It’s no longer just the giants in the agricultural space with the resources to bring exciting biotech-derived products to market; now, the little guy can, too.
Such changes, Nathan says, signal a new era of agriculture.
""I strongly believe we're entering into a new era where we're going to see a lot of new products that are enabled with biotechnology.”
Nathan Pumplin
President and CEO
Norfolk Health Produce
But are consumers ready for it?
Evolving attitudes & the future
Public attitudes have long been divided on the topic of GMOs, with some heralding the exciting possibilities and others applying the precautionary principle to the technology. Strong opinions on both sides led to heavy polarization.
These days, things are changing. The lines have become a little more blurred between the two camps as consumers gain ever more produce options.
GMO skeptics have led to a booming organic industry and the widespread adoption of the non-GMO certified label. There are more options than ever for diehard opponents.
Meanwhile, some of these hardline attitudes have softened as products like the impossible burger have courted consumers more concerned with animal welfare than genetic engineering. Likewise, bioengineering’s role in shaping a more equitable and sustainable future is changing minds across the board.
“Biotechnology is not inherently good or bad.”
Nathan Pumplin
President and CEO
Norfolk Health Produce
On the other hand, the historically cost-prohibitive nature of getting genetically engineered produce to market has meant, until recently, only the most profitable row-crops have been transformed by the practice. Today’s less burdensome regulatory environment, however, opens the door to more GMO options.
While Nathan doesn’t expect to win over everybody, he believes that there is room in the market for produce of all types. Further, he argues that those won over by the impossible burger is a sign that consumers now have a more nuanced understanding of GMOs — and that’s a great sign for the purple tomato.
The purple tomato’s biotech bona fides may even win others, Nathan says. Many people who associate genetic engineering with pesticides and behemoth agricultural corporations haven’t yet seen biotech used to maximize nutrition and beauty.
So, what does the future hold for the purple tomato and bioengineered produce?
Nathan says the purple tomato will start hitting shelves next year in a limited capacity next year, with a wide scale rollout to finish by 2025. As for the market, he thinks the options for consumers will only increase — and attitudes will continue to soften.
And there is one aspirational future he is dying to see come to pass:
“I’d love to see the purple tomato on display in the Museum of Modern Art in a few years as an example of a beautiful piece of creation the very creative scientist Cathie Martin was able to put together based on a discovery she made about the natural world,” he says. “This is such a cool example of a nature-based solution.”
So, be on the lookout for the purple tomato’s masterful fusion of art and science on grocery store shelves — or gallery walls — near you.

Limited access to fresh fruits and vegetables is the biggest reason consumers aren’t getting their recommended daily requirements of produce.
With the help of Tom Adams, CEO at Pairwise, the organization is changing how fruits and veggies are grown, innovating with technological advances in the farming and growing industries. All of these efforts are to help expand and increase access to fresh produce for everyday consumers.
Join us as we discuss:
Using technology to break down produce access barriers
Consumer transparency of new growing techniques
How Pairwise’s innovation will help address climate change
Breaking down the barriers that limit produce access
Those in the agriculture industry are faced with the challenge of producing enough food to feed the population of the future. With an estimated 10 billion hungry people in 2050, leaders in farming and growing often settle on the concept of ramping up corn and soybean production.
While this option would feed people nonetheless, it fails to address the entire issue of nutrition and completely excuses potential satisfaction and optimal health.
Tom Adams and other leaders at Pairwise are thinking differently. Using technology, they aim to break barriers that bar 90% of Americans from getting the fresh produce they need into their diets. Tom says, “It's not just about having enough calories, it's about having the right calories and nutritious calories.”
Throughout previous decades, there have been subtle innovations in produce, according to Tom. Before the release of the easy-peel mandarin, citrus sales were down. Now, the easy-peel mandarin is a popular choice, adding benefits to the diets of millions of adults and children worldwide.
Breeding has been the deliverer of many similar innovations in fruits and vegetables, as breeders aim to make food more accessible, affordable, and plentiful. However, breeding produce for the optimal result can take decades. This is where technological advances come in.
Using gene-editing technology, Pairwise, and other innovators can achieve nutritious results in half the time, making fresh fruits and vegetables more available and accessible for everyday people.
Flavor, convenience, and the importance of transparency
When developing new products, Pairwise focuses on a few things: flavor, convenience, and quality product. While their methods are innovative and offer endless benefits, there are still questions and hesitancy around the technology used in their product development.
This is one of the many reasons why Pairwise highlights the importance of transparency with consumers.
While a vast majority of people are excited about the new technology delivering better-tasting produce in greater numbers to a larger population, there is still some lingering fear for some. Eager to adopt technology in transportation, clothing, and consumer tech, some consumers still hesitate to accept gene editing as a safe, delicious alternative to traditional breeding.
According to Tom, this is widely due to a lack of knowledge and understanding of the tech. By offering full transparency, speaking with consumers directly, and educating the public about farming and growing innovations, Pairwise is set to feed the world and change how they think about food.
When it comes to business, Tom says, “We want, as a company, to be really good at the two ends of the supply chain — creating really unique genetics and then differentiating through marketing.” So, while many would partner with existing produce companies already in the market, Pairwise aims to build its own brand, emphasizing transparency to distinctly community value across the supply chain and directly to consumers.
The two sides to climate change and how Pairwise is addressing them
Pairwise isn’t just out to change how the world eats, they are also conscious of climate change and actively working to combat it.
According to Tom, climate change has two sides- the things we are doing to cause climate change right now and the things we need to do to adapt to the effects of climate change.
Pairwise is working to genetically edit crops to be more adapted to warmer climates, more productive with fewer resources, and more easily grown without as much manual input. This means less fuel would be needed to plant, cultivate, and harvest crops, and there would be less waste and more fruitful harvests.
Ultimately, the innovations that create better, more accessible produce also results in an agriculture system that works to slow and combat climate change while adapting to the results of environmental shifts.
Tom highlights this environmental awareness as vital to the identity and brand of Pairwise. He says, “The one most important thing, at the end of the day is — 10 years from now, 15 years from now — we're going to go into produce, and we're going to see branded produce that customers are enjoying.”
Breaking through the static of farming and growing, Pairwise is set to establish innovations that shape the health of future populations by offering produce that is readily available, affordable, and delicious while also retaining full transparency. They aim to educate the public and have a positive impact on the environment, lending to a sustainable future that extends beyond corn and beans production.

Across the US, very few people eat enough fruits and vegetables.
This spells negative ramifications for our health — especially in lower-income areas.
Simply put, healthy food is medicine — so why aren’t we prescribing it?
Well, a recent guest to the show Sam Hoeffler, Program Manager at Reinvestment Partners, is doing exactly that. Sam helps lead the Eat Well program, which helps families throughout North Carolina access healthy food choices by providing funding that can be used to purchase fruits and vegetables.
In this blog adapted from that conversation, we discuss:
The genesis of the Eat Well program in North Carolina
The results so far
The future of the program
Prescribing food
It probably doesn’t come as much of a surprise to read that many Americans aren’t eating enough fruits and vegetables. In fact, many people reading this may be thinking “I’m not eating enough fruits and vegetables.”
People know that a diet rich with varied produce leads to better healthcare outcomes, but there are all manner of reasons that people still don’t eat enough. Whether it’s due to financial constraints or access, our diets can impact society as a whole.
That’s why the Eat Well program was created — to prescribe the food-based medicine so many people need.
""It wasn't, ‘Everyone could benefit in a different way, so let's give everyone fruits and vegetables.’ It was, ‘Who do we think really needs this and will it have a direct impact on their health?""
Sam Hoeffler
Program Manager
Reinvestment Partners
In 2018, the Eat Well program was given a USDA grant for half a million dollars; today, they’ve supplied $6 million in produce, with nearly four times that much in the pipeline.
How?
The program may have started out relying on modest grants, but in order to scale, Sam says they knew they needed to seek out deeper pockets. From those with more skin in the game.
So, they sought to get the healthcare industry onboard. And it worked. Upping the population’s fruit and vegetable intake leads to better health outcomes, which is a boon for those in the healthcare sector.
And, of course, it doesn’t hurt that the results are already demonstrating the program’s value.
The results
While the idea of food prescriptions is older than the Eat Well program, it has a couple core principles undergirding the prescription model that sets it apart:
They always strive to meet people where they are.In practice, this means without letting those enrolled in the program get their produce where they already shop, it adds unnecessary friction. A program designed to make it easier to access fruits and vegetables shouldn’t have hoops to jump through — it defeats the purpose.
People should be able to buy their own food.In crafting the prescription program, it was obvious that simply dropping off a prepackaged box of produce on someone’s doorstep was, somewhat ironically, too prescriptive. It’s pretty hard to get people to eat more produce if you’re not letting them choose fruits and vegetables that their family actually enjoys.“It’s really about dignity and trusting people to buy the food that works for them,” Sam says.These core principles are, in large part, what Sam attributes to the success of the program, which is now providing families across North Carolina with gift cards to get $40 worth of fruits and vegetables per month.
""It doesn’t matter if this person is in a very rural geography or an urban space, our challenge is to make sure that every single person's experience is exactly the same.""
Sam Hoeffler
Program Manager
Reinvestment Partners
Now, this money is helping lead to better health outcomes, which is great for the individuals involved, the healthcare industry — even the grocery stores, since members tend to spend significantly more on produce than just the funds allotted by the program.
On top of that, many of those enrolled are well below the federal poverty line, which means that the program is helping tackle the issues with hunger the country faces.
Despite the program's many wins, Sam says they're only just getting started.
The future of food as medicine
Sam is optimistic that the future is bright for the Eat Well program, which she hopes to see scale far beyond its current scope. In fact, she is confident enough to refer to the program as a “billion-dollar idea.” And she has good reasons for this optimism.
For example, she points to overtures the current administration is making that suggest they are taking the idea of food as medicine seriously.
“What we're excited about around the White House Conference is that it seems like they're making food as medicine a priority.”
Sam Hoeffler
Program Manager
Reinvestment Partners
The interest the executive branch has shown in tackling this issue bodes well for the long-term success Sam forecasts for scaling the program.
She believes the future of the program needs to start by getting more players in the healthcare sector involved — particularly on the insurance side of things. To her, it’s only a matter of time: Insurance companies that keep their customers healthy are the ones that do the best financially — so it should be a no-brainer.
From there, she wants to see the government step in in a much greater capacity, recognizing the right for people to access healthier food and helping to fund it on a national level.
Ultimately, these are just steps along the way to her ultimate goal: to change the systems and processes such that access to fruits and vegetables is something everyone has in equal measure.
That’s the real billion-dollar idea.

Some of the most nutritious food on Earth is, unfortunately, also some of the toughest produce to grow.
Joyce Van Eck, Associate Professor at Boyce Thompson Institute, is helping growers better understand the practice of gene editing so they can increase production and expand access to highly nutritious crops.
Join us as we discuss:
Plant biotechnology and bringing gene editing to our food
Studying plant genes to improve crop growth
Understanding CRISPR to fast track domestication of crops and help combat climate change
Biotechnology today
Have you ever eaten a ground cherry? How about a golden berry?
Both of these fruits have enormous potential and are incredibly nutritious. Yet, you’ll be hard pressed to find them on store shelves when you’re doing your weekend shopping — and even when you do find them, they tend to go for exorbitant prices.
That’s because despite their potential, these crops have some annoying characteristics that make farming them on a mass scale less appealing than the staple crops we’re all accustomed to seeing in the produce section. But that could be changing.
Thanks to today’s biotechnology, trailblazers like Joyce are conducting research into — and figuring out how to do something about — the genes in these crops that cause the plant’s undesirable characteristics. As a result, shoppers may soon be adjusting their expectations when they wander through the produce section.
Today’s biotech goes far beyond just diversifying our local food supply, though; it can be transformative globally, too.
In addition to the ground cherry and the golden berry that she primarily works with, Joyce says that she and her team’s work in the Physalis Improvement Project at Boyce Thompson Institute is helping many low-income, food-insecure regions. One example they are looking at is a type of eggplant — one quite different from the hulking purple ones we buy (in much smaller quantities).
An eggplant in the US isn't a very big crop. But in countries like Africa and Southeast Asia, they are a big part of the diet.
Joyce Van Eck
Associate Professor
Boyce Thompson Institute
With some adjustments, these crops that are already widely grown globally — only on much smaller scales — could potentially become a much more reliable staple. That would benefit growers and consumers in many regions where food security is a concern.
Winning with genetics
With so many crops held back by one or two niggling undesirable traits, it makes sense that researchers like Joyce are eager to find ways to unlock their full potential.
But what are the issues with these crops — and, perhaps more importantly, how can biotech be deployed to solve them?
In the case of the ground cherry, its name may have already given the game away. This variety of cherry has a tendency to — yep, you guessed it — touch the ground, resulting in a fruit that is more susceptible to insects and more likely to encounter pathogens. On top of that, the plants tend to sprawl, resulting in an inefficient strain on most growers’ limited farmland.
The golden berry — a close relative of the tomato that looks like a yellow cherry tomato, but tastes much sweeter — on the other hand, doesn’t sprawl. But… a full-grown crop is over six feet tall, which presents its own problems.
Other underutilized crops may suffer from being prickly, or the fruiting bodies being too small — or even just the inability to handle tiny variations in weather from the climate they evolved in. All of these things can potentially be fixed, which would help all of us.
And, like all agriculture, it all comes down to genetics.
I love that we're focusing on the societal and consumer benefits, not the methodology.
Vonnie Estes
Vice President AgFood Tech Innovation
The International Fresh Produce Association
Almost none of the staple items from the produce aisle we consume regularly comes bearing much of a resemblance to their pre-agricultural ancestors. That’s thanks to our species’ efforts over the last 10,000 years in selecting desirable genes, while removing those responsible for prickles, sprawl and tiny fruits.
Traditionally, this project has been almost entirely achieved through selective breeding. These days, biotech has some innovative tools at its disposal to accomplish the same thing in a fraction of the time.
CRISPR & gene editing
In today’s biotechnology sector, gene editing is safer and easier than ever before.
With newer technologies like CRISPR becoming much more affordable, gene editing is poised to solve many issues that have proved intractable when tackled with traditional selective breeding techniques. As the advantages become more widely known — and people reap the benefits — gene editing will likely be recognized for exactly what it is: one among many innovative tools at modern agriculture’s disposal to deliver better outcomes for growers and consumers alike.
For researchers like Joyce, the myriad benefits that technologies like CRISPR afford vastly outweigh the misinformed bad press.
An example she cites is an uncharacteristically compact tomato plant one farmer found in his field a century ago. Turns out, this crop had a novel mutation that was, ultimately, a highly desirable trait.
With traditional breeding methods, encouraging this trait to flourish enough to capitalize involves a whole lot of trial and error — with a lot less precision; any time you are selecting for one trait, you may unintentionally select for other, less desirable traits.
With gene editing tools like CRISPR, Joyce and her colleagues are able to encourage these beneficial mutations without risking the crop’s other desirable traits. And that’s vital for many underutilized crops — especially in less developed regions.
If we take the eggplant example from before, then we find a crop that is already perfectly adapted to the environment. But due to the undesirable traits hampering its commercial viability, it’s rarely grown beyond a subsistence level.
Genetic research and gene editing can change that — and everybody will benefit.
In developing countries, gene editing can reduce food insecurity by giving growers (and ultimately, consumers) a more reliable variant of the foods they are already consuming. In the developed world, gene editing can help safely counter invasive pests like the potato beetle, reducing our use of pesticides.
Globally, gene editing technology can help diversify everyone’s food supply by giving crops the ability to thrive in a wider range of environments, with a longer shelf for easier distribution. It can even help counteract climate change by reducing our crops' growing susceptibility to disease, which, in turn, also reduces food waste.
Far from being scary, gene editing is simply another color in a breeder or a farmer’s palette. It’s what they choose to paint with it that really matters.
And it’s early days, but the picture they’re painting of agriculture’s future is already shaping up to be a masterpiece.

Students are heading back to school, but don’t forget about one of the most important parts of the day - - lunch!
Join us as we connect with foodservice administrators, Fred Espinosa, Director of Food and Nutrition and Janelle Manzano, Farm to School Program Specialist, both with San Diego Unified School District, California’s second-largest school district. Discover how they are prioritizing fresh produce and nutrition education as part of the thousands of meals they serve each day. Whether it’s school-site gardens, salad bars, farmer trading cards, virtual farm tours or in-class nutrition education, the San Diego Unified School District is leading the way, when it comes to promoting fresh fruit and veggies.
Join us as we discuss:
School meals with updated nutrition standards that require fruits and veggies
Farm to School programming in the San Diego Unified School District
Creating a hands-on experience for students with school gardens
Attending the IFPA Foodservice Conference with other K-12 school foodservice leaders
Enabling student health with fresh local produce and education
Every day, 31 million children participate in National School Lunch Program and must exit their lunch line with a fruit or vegetable on their plate.
Schools are also required to serve a variety of produce options each week, with many offering entrée salads, fresh vegetable side-dishes, grab n’ go fruit and veggies, and even a return to self-serve salad bars. In addition to lunch, many K-12 schools also offer breakfast, in-class fresh fruit and vegetable snacks, and an after-school supper program.
K-12 schools are large volume foodservice buyers that serve tens-of-thousands of meals to schoolchildren every day. They are often the “largest restaurant in town” and play an important role to introduce kids to a variety of fresh produce, potentially shaping their comfort-level (and taste preferences) for years to come.
Additionally, Farm to School programs are growing (literally!) in school districts across the country. Farm to School benefits a wide range of stakeholders, including students, teachers, parents, community members, and of course, local agriculture partners, such as produce growers, foodservice distributors and more….
Fred Espinosa and Janelle Manzano from the San Diego Unified School District lead one of the most robust Farm to School programs in the country, all while managing the foodservice program for the second-largest school district in California and one of the largest school districts in the Country. Don’t be fooled though. Just because they are in southern California, doesn’t mean the Farm to School programs and partnerships are easy. It takes a lot of time, effort and partnerships.
According to Fred and Janelle, offering of produce in schools is just the beginning. Education about the farming process, health benefits, and meal creation is crucial to fostering students’ long-term desire for fresh fruit and veggies. And this education is being done using a variety of technology, which helps reach more students with their nutrition education messages.
When we are able to show the videos to the children, teachers and parents, they get engaged in fruits and vegetables, and technology has allowed us to do that.
Fred Espinosa
Specialist for Farm to School Program
Students also benefit from hands-on experiences with tastings, health and cooking classes, produce incorporation into curricula, virtual field trips and tours, and school gardening programs.
Multifaceted benefits of school gardens and local partnerships
According to Janelle, hands-on learning experiences such as school gardens and experiential learning increase interest by “selling the sizzle.” Cultivating student interest and investment is vital for building long-term healthy eaters.
Creating these school garden experiences can help make healthy choices more enjoyable and fun while teaching students how to grow their own food.
Janelle describes what she’s seen in these school garden projects. She says, “It's really awesome to see the students get their hands in the dirt and really make those connections.”
Parents and teachers also have the opportunity to get involved with garden experiences. Educators can utilize produce, growing cycles, and concepts related to the life cycle of plants in curricula, giving them a tangible asset to teach with.
Further, many schools allow parents and guardians to volunteer throughout the gardening experience. This allows shared experience and knowledge to expand beyond school grounds.
Finally, local farms have the opportunity to get involved in the school systems. Whether they offer physical tours, virtual tour experiences, classroom lectures, take-home seeds, or something else, local farms can help connect students to the local community and economy.
Benefits across stakeholders in state-wide expansion
Janelle and Fred discuss the exciting possibilities of widespread expansion of Farm to School programs across the state of California and beyond.
The benefits of combining traditional education with nutrition education are clear, and this program is particularly impactful because it’s accessible to all students, regardless of income level.
Also, starting this year in California, the state government has stepped-in to support “universal meals”, which means schools will make meals available at no-cost to all students. This, combined with federal nutrition standards that require serving a fruit and vegetable to students each day as they walk through the lunch line, it’s easy to see how fresh fruits and veggies are becoming easily accessible to children in ways like never before.
In addition to these benefits for students, Farm to School programs also benefit our agriculture partners, including local growers and our produce distributor.
According to Janelle, “Farm to School encompasses local procurement and bringing those fresh fruits and vegetables into our school cafeteria.”
Local farms can reap the immediate benefits of an enormous institutional buyer, like our school district. These partners have come to realize that schools are large volume foodservice buyers, are consistent business, don’t go out of business, we pay on time, and through our programs, can impact children’s taste preferences for years to come.
Understanding the value of partnering K-12 school foodservice programs, and Farm to School initiatives, can go a long way toward developing the next generation of interested, engaged, and excited produce consumers.

Growing crops at full capacity is one of farmer's many extreme challenges. But some innovations help them create new techniques to meet these challenges head-on — like vertical farming.
With the help of Netled and Kasey Snyder, Sales Operations Manager, they are expanding the innovation of vertical farming to help farmers grow their crops at a higher capacity in any condition nature throws at them.
Join us as we discuss:
Marketing Netled to prospective growers and U.S. expansion
Developing new technologies in farming
Making vertical farming commercially viable
Marketing innovation: Attracting customers to the hidden machine behind the business
Netled was never built to be advertised on their seller’s product. Instead, as the hidden machine behind the business, Netled has always intended to create produce so incredible that no one wonders what the technology behind it is.
While this strategy helps growers utilizing Netled systems create the best, most efficient business, it can make marketing difficult. Luckily, the results of these vertical farming systems help build a use case for others in agriculture.
Our job is to make resellers shine. Our job is to ensure that their production is so flawless, seamless, and consistent, that no one ever wonders how the crop was grown or where it came from.
Kasey Snyder
Sales enablement and digital collaboration specialist.
According to Kasey, most of Netled’s marketing strategy exists around inbound inquiries. Vertical growing is currently on-trend, drawing the attention of inexperienced hobby growers and commercial farmers alike.
Netled also attends agriculture, farming, floral, and vegetable conferences and events, educating traditional growers, retailers, distributors, and wholesalers. By getting in front of these individuals and educating them on how vertical farming works and eradicating the misconceptions built around it, they help these growers decide if they are serious about the vertical growing space.
Finally, Netled has invested in creating a robust social media presence. With a social and cultural focus on locally grown and organic produce, many growers and consumers are attracted to Netled’s products. Increased brand visibility continues to draw in interested parties.
Developing new technologies, then tailoring them to client needs
One of Netled’s biggest challenges is also its biggest strength. Each vertical growing system is unique, with innovative technologies specifically tailored to the client, what they intend to grow, and the environment they are growing in. The custom approach works wonders for growers’ crops but also presents issues with pricing quotes and education, particularly considering the diversity of client needs.
Fortunately, with time and practice, Netled has developed a system that can educate and serve its customers most effectively and efficiently.
“We've created a map for how we educate someone — what they need to look for, what's going to create the best growing environment for various crops, and how to monitor.
Kasey Snyder
Sales enablement and digital collaboration specialist.
Not only are the technologies and systems built to the needs of each customer, but the services offered by the company are too. For self-sufficient, experienced vertical growers, hands-off services include the tech alone. But, for those that want more support in learning about each system and maintaining it over time, Netled has solutions.
Ultimately, Kasey and other leaders at Netled are excited about their developments across agriculture and the many innovations to come. Working with each customer to provide the educational foundation, vertical growing setup and tech, and long-term support and maintenance creates a service organization that truly values its customers and the future of agriculture.
With this value comes big aspirations. Kasey hopes Netled will grow to be a vital piece of large-scale commercial agriculture soon– and these goals aren’t too far out of reach.
Commercial viability: Vertical farming as the future of the industry
Vertical growing has broken into the commercial space. With a no-competition mindset, Netled has already secured its place with product-market fit.
Having recently made their first commercial deal, Netled is working with a business that grows 2.7 million pots of herbs annually sold in 340 stores across Sweden. This partnership has been a significant milestone on the way to commercial viability, and Kasey says someday, it will be their smallest partnership.
Our goal is to make vertical farming commercially viable. We're meant to do this at a very large scale, and be able to repeat the process in different locations for customers.
Kasey Snyder
Sales enablement and digital collaboration specialist.
The closed-loop growing system is one crucial factor that sets Netled apart from others within the market. These vertical farming systems exist in a way that all aspects of cultivation inform one another. Irrigation, climate, lighting, airflow, nutrients, and all other factors communicate within a closed loop system so that each crop season can be controlled or influenced for optimal growth and development.
While Netled has created this tailored, automated, and innovative system, they also pride themselves on partnership in the pre and post-growing phases.
Changing the world of agriculture and horticulture is not an easy feat. Netled has already made leaps and bounds but understands that a genuinely substantial impact will require partnering with similarly innovative and passional businesses.

The uncertainty of farming conditions is one of the toughest challenges the produce industry faces.
We sat down with Founder and CEO Ros Harvey of The Yield, to learn how he is tackling this challenge while fulfilling the company’s mission to create a digital playbook using valuable data from farmers to help protect their produce.
Join us as we discuss:
Establishing digital playbooks to improve growing and supply chain conditions
Solving uncertainty in farming, like weather
Developing a sales cycle based on value through data collection
Ready to change the farming business model through analytics? Let’s dig deeper!
What we're doing is connecting what happens on the farm with how you translate that into value.
Ros Harvey
CEO
The Yield
Choosing produce over corn or wheat
Ross Harvey founded The Yield, an Australian ag-tech company, so he could leverage data science to provide produce growers with digital playbooks they could use to improve growing operations and supply chains.
Why did Ross focus on produce instead of the big money crops like corn or wheat?
The main reason: It's a $1.5 trillion opportunity globally.
Three other reasons:
Historically, the producer has been underserved by technology.
You've got 40 times the gross margin per acre in fresh produce than you do in row cropping and commodity crops.
In fresh produce, the value chain is actually very important, and comes with a lot more integration
#3 is key. The Yield's product solves on-farm challenges and links on-farm production with the value chain, which means having tighter integration matters. Produce growers are not just contract growing. They are also packing, processing, and market shipping.
That kind of integration makes it much easier to work with them to solve problems that create multiple value points along the value chain (we'll come back to this point later).
Digital playbooks improve growing and supply chain operations for farmers
The fundamental problem Ross solves is the uncertainty created by weather. It is the one variable a grower cannot control.
Ross has created digital playbooks that make recommendations matching genetics with the local environment and weather conditions. They do this using what's called gridded weather, two-dimensional data mapped evenly across a matrix.
The starting point is creating a picture of ‘what's now today, and where do you want to get to?’ and getting very clear on that roadmap.
Ros Harvey
CEO
The Yield
Finally doing something about the weather
Mark Twain famously quipped that everyone wants to talk about the weather, but no one does anything about it. Ross is busy proving Twain wrong.
You read that right: He’s actually doing something about the weather.
Solving the problems of apples and wine
Take apples, for instance. When you grow apples, the most important decision you have to make at the very early part of the season is how to get the right fruit set, which means you've got the right number of blossoms on the tree that turn into fruit. In New Zealand, they use two different products they use to help them get the right number of blossoms, and both of them are weather dependent.
The Yield took this protocol and rolled it out across 13 different sites to get the best possible outcome. Farmers said it was the best thinning season they’ve had in 30 years.
In the case of Australia's wine industry, Ross is managing 20% of the vintage, and predicting, 18 months in advance, what that vintage is actually going to produce using his digital playbook. So far, he's 97% accurate.
Selling to the pre and post-farming markets
Two-thirds of The Yield's annual recurring revenue doesn't come from growers. It comes from the pre-farm gate, or post-farm gate — marketers who want to know what's coming to get better value from what the grower is producing.
Look at it this way:
Large family enterprises are growing 30-50% of production. They'll have a core contracting group where there's quite a stable relationship, and then they'll have spot marketing.
So, they're actually trying to manage a portfolio of growing assets to give them flexibility, and then they are geographically distributed for the same reason or this weather risk. They are buyers.
But so are the people creating genetics for a particular variety of crops. They have a very strong interest in the grower achieving the best possible outcome. Other buyers include people who are developing bio solutions that are very weather dependent.
If we're going to move the dial on data and create trust in the digital economy, we need to be clear about how we're using data and how the people we're helping create that data can participate in the value creation process.
Ros Harvey
CEO
The Yield
The value of data and ongoing collection
People say data is the new oil. That's not true. You use oil once, and it's gone. No matter how many times you use data, it never spoils. In fact, the more models you run, the more value you create.
The issue is that most regulatory frameworks were designed to protect individuals, not to advance the corporate good. As a result, The Yield has put agreements in place with some of its large corporate consumers that allow them to use their data and create better models for everyone.
""I'm really excited about this,"" Ross told us. ""People are told, 'Oh, you own your data.' But what people don't understand is that you might only own input data.""
Once your data has been combined or transformed into something else, if you don't have rights that carry all the way through to the value created there, you don't own very much. You just own a series of zeros and ones.
If we can optimize all along the value chain, we can reduce waste, stop the buffering, and make sure that we're giving feedback from what's happening in real-time to adjust the playbook, then… we can get exactly what's needed by the market.
Everybody wins.

Nexus Robotics is one of this year’s winners in IFPA’s Fresh Field Catalyst technology accelerator. It was founded in 2017 by engineering students from Halifax who wanted to disrupt and improve traditional farming practices.
They’re building innovative robotic tools that will free growers from backbreaking repetitive tasks — and encourage Canada’s agriculture industry to become more sustainable.
Teric Greenan is the COO, and his city-born perspective helps him ideate incisive solutions to agricultural issues.
Luc Labbe, CEO at Nexus, brings a wealth of experience and in-depth agronomic knowledge.
Join us as we discuss:
How robotic tech will help solve the agricultural labor shortage and lower costs
Teaching robots how to identify between different plants and eradicate weeds
Automating the dirty and dangerous jobs that no one wants to do
Adding value for farmers
Intelligent machines could solve many of the problems that plague modern farming — let’s dig deeper!
If we want to have a sustainable food system, we're going to need to innovate and create technologies that can do these tasks.
Teric Greenan
COO
Nexus
What's Wrong With Farming?
A city kid who dropped out of engineering school, Teric was spending a lot of time in his vegetable garden. Then in 2017, he traveled across Canada and spent time on some farms where he really fell in love with agriculture.
Teric's engineering mind kicked in when he saw all the systems that make farms productive. Once Teric himself started a farm, he got opportunities to talk with a lot of the larger-scale growers in the area. He was shocked about how much time and resources they were spending on repetitive tasks.
As an engineer, Teric knew that robots were good candidates to replace some of the tasks that humans were doing by hand. So he set out to start a company that would bring the best in AI to the best in agriculture. To do that, Teric brought on two friends he knew from engineering school.
Luc joined them when Teric's investors said he needed an agronomist, someone bilingual, and most importantly, someone experienced to help these young guys run their company and solve the labor shortage problem on farms.
Solving the Labor Shortage, One Robot at a Time
As consumers, we want agriculture to be sustainable. Right now, North Americans accomplish that through migrant workers from Central America, who come to our countries and pull the weeds out of our fields by hand. That model works for just one reason — our economies are stronger than their economies.
That model cannot last forever, though. The Central American countries are quickly catching up, and their economies are growing as well. A day will come when people from Central America don't want to leave their families for six months and pull weeds in the fields of Canada or the United States.
Farmers are already having issues with the cost of labor and labor availability — and it seems like these problems are only getting worse. When human beings don't want to pull out our weeds, we'll have two choices:
Live with an unsustainable food system, or…
nnovate and create technologies to do these tasks.
For Luc and Teric, it's not a choice: Innovation is essential.
Put simply: To make healthy foods like vegetables available at a low cost, we need to develop more technologies to help us produce them.
I want more people to grow vegetables so that it's more accessible for the public. If we can create technologies that help farmers produce affordable crops, that's my number one concern.
Teriuc Greenan
COO
Nexus
Teaching Robots to Farm
If you watch one of Teric and Luc's robots in action, what would you see?
You'd see an articulated mechanical arm that mimics a human arm, and it would be pulling weeds out of the ground by mechanical hand. It can pull weeds at any stage of development.
Does that sound inefficient? Surprisingly, it's the way we do things right now only with human hands. As Luc told us, ""The origin of the design idea was to try to do it as closely as possible to the humans.""
Pluck the Weeds, Don't Kill the Plants
How does the robot know a weed from a plant?
That's the thorniest question Luc and Teric have to face.
To do so, they build a model for each crop, which requires about three weeks of rotation and images. Right now, the robot can work on any of the row crops because the company has models for lettuce, carrots, cabbage, and a few other things.
""As the demand comes in and we have more people to work with us,"" Luc said, ""then we'll come in with pretty much any crop.""
What we want to do is bring the technology forward and have as many people as possible see it — and see that it works.
Luc Labbe
CEO
NEXUS
Dirty & Dangerous: Automating the Jobs Nobody Wants to Do
Across industries, we automate the jobs humans don't want to do — basically, the jobs that are dirty or dangerous.
Field workers don't want to be out in the field pulling weeds. They all want to be in the pack house where it's air-conditioned. If you've ever pulled weeds, you'll know why!
Weeding a field is a simple, repetitive task, and conventional wisdom says that the simpler a task is, the quicker it'll be automated. It’s also true that the less enjoyable a task is, the quicker it will be automated, Teric adds.
Pulling weeds is simple, dirty, boring, and slightly dangerous. Automating this task is the perfect value-add for farmers and consumers alike.
It's not the first time we've replaced farm hands with machines. Think about tractors.
Creating Exponential Value for Farmers
Farmers love tractors. They are versatile machines. You can hook up pretty much anything to a tractor and it will do the work.
Teric and Luc are trying to emulate that versatility with their bots. Teric says, ""If we can have one robot that's capable of doing many, many tasks for the farmers on one unit, it adds a lot more value. It's not just like one plus one, it adds value exponentially.""
The more features that get added to the robot, the more versatile the technology becomes, and the more valuable farmers will find it.

With the current supply chain issues, enjoying fresh and nutritious produce is more costly and difficult than ever before.
Consumers demand consistency, which hasn’t been possible with traditional methods. But technology is enabling producers to deliver great value and the best possible eating experience.
Kaitlin Fitzgerald is the VP of Sustainability at one of IFPA’s Fresh Field Catalyst winners, Sound Agriculture. They’re passionate about building a better and more sustainable food system.
Dorn Wenninger, Senior VP Produce at UNFI, is her mentor in our program and an industry expert with over 30 years of experience in the field.
Join us as we discuss:
The qualities buyers expect from their produce and how tech makes this possible
How providing consistency and a great experience increases repeat business
Partnerships, packaging, and produce branding
Taste, freshness, and affordability
Technology is becoming a crucial driver for delivering the value customers crave — let’s dig deeper!
If we want to have a sustainable food system, we're going to need to innovate and create technologies that can do these tasks.
Teric Greenan
COO
Nexus
On-demand crop solutions
An alumna of the University of Notre Dame as well as Harvard Business School, Kaitlin has been with Sound Agriculture for two thrilling years.
She started her career in the hallowed halls of finance but moved into strategic planning with a sojourn to Lagos, Nigeria. Pivoting to product marketing and business development, Kaitlin built an impressively well-rounded resume that landed her in the VP of Sustainability seat.
Sound Agriculture’s main mission is to create solutions that leverage the inherent genetic traits of the plant without using GMOs. Their approach is fast, cost-effective, and customer-centric.
In their goal to breed a better tomato, Kaitlin says “we’re using on-demand breeding to extend the window of peak flavor and shelf life” of rich heirloom varieties to allow for more versatility and durability when it comes to facing supply chain challenges.
Key consumer trends
When bringing any product to market, it’s critical to know your buyer’s pain points and what they want and need to solve their issues.
Kaitlin and Sound Agriculture are addressing several vital consumer demands:
Snackable produce
Sustainable growing practices
Better flavor
Longer shelf life
""The number one attributes that customers look for is freshness and consistency,"" as Dorn points out. A produce industry expert for over three decades, Dorn is a fluent Spanish speaker and MBA who’s worked in the UK, Malaysia, and Mexico.
I want more people to grow vegetables so that it's more accessible for the public. If we can create technologies that help farmers produce affordable crops, that's my number one concern.
Teriuc Greenan

Great eating quality
It all comes down to ensuring a completely enjoyable eating experience every time.
That’s what keeps coming customers back to buy your product. Kaitlin stresses how working with focus groups and customer panels helps Sound Agriculture determine the value propositions and attributes of their produce.
She realized that while the visual appeal is an important factor in attracting shoppers, as “consumers buy with their eyes,” her tomato was far superior in flavor.
What’s the most effective way to cut down on customer trial and error and make your product stand out?
Partnerships, packaging, and branding
Emerging agritech is making sustainable food choices more ubiquitous and more affordable for the average consumer.
The perceived cost-to-value ratio is the main roadblock to produce sales in today’s grocery stores. People don’t want to spend a lot of money on a fruit or vegetable that might not meet their taste expectations.
Partnering with retail outlets guarantees customers have consistent access to education about their choice of delicious and unique produce. “Local” and “organic” are the Holy Grail for product packaging in this industry, and the easiest for shoppers to understand.
Kaitlin mentions that people need three core elements to change their behavior:
Motivation
Ability
Trigger impulse
She believes that technology is unlocking this equation to educate and influence consumers and drive demand.
What we want to do is bring the technology forward and have as many people as possible see it — and see that it works.
Luc Labbe
CEO
NEXUS
Taste is king
Dorn puts it perfectly: “If a product doesn’t taste good, people aren’t going to buy it.”
Introducing innovations is what drives per capita consumption forward. Brand awareness, flavor, sustainability, nutrition, and affordability — these are the aspects that Dorn and Kaitlin are focusing on and leveraging with the latest technology.
The pandemic has brought health and wellness back to the forefront while inflation has made consumers feel the pinch in the produce aisle.
However, Dorn is “bullish on produce in the medium and long term. There’s no doubt in my mind that it will outpace other growth industries.” But in the short term, bringing down price points is absolutely critical.
The Fresh Field Catalyst
The IFPA is dedicated to increasing the accessibility and consumption of healthy fresh produce.
Our Fresh Field Catalyst is a technology accelerator designed to bring together innovative startups and market experts from around the world to develop practical solutions to major sector challenges such as labor shortages, resource scarcity, and climate change.
Kaitlin states that the immersive program is “an amazing experience,” with incredible access to industry thought leaders and offering invaluable mentorship and networking opportunities.

Vonnie Estes, IFPA
Hello, I'm Vonnie Estes, your host of Fresh Takes on Tech. This season we are highlighting companies and the Fresh Field Catalyst accelerator. The accelerator is a six-month program from the International Fresh Produce Association, bringing new technology into the produce industry. For more information on the accelerator, you can contact me or go to freshproduce.com. So today we have two guests on the show. Julie Escobar, the Chief Commercial Officer at DiMuto, who is a participant in the accelerator, and Judy Clark, CEO at Fresh Texas, who was also Julie's mentor in the program. Welcome to you both. It's really great to have you.
So Julie, let's start with you. Would you please tell us about DiMuto and your role?
Julie Escobar, DiMuto
Yes, well, excited to be here. Vonnie. DiMuto is an active company headquartered in Singapore. Our main core business is to bring a global marketplace, finance solution, and traceability to small, medium, and large farmers. And I am currently their Chief Commercial Officer. And yeah, excited to be here.
Vonnie Estes, IFPA
Great, and where are you located?
Julie Escobar, DiMuto
I am based in Central Oregon. And I am responsible for managing all of the North America.
Vonnie Estes, IFPA
So the company is global. It's going to all the different countries and offering solutions, right?
Julie Escobar, DiMuto
Correct, yeah. So we have a strong team of almost 14-15 people in Singapore. And then I am building my team in Latin America and here in the U.S. So we already have a full-time employee in Colombia in South America, and trying to fill the second position in Mexico at the moment.
Vonnie Estes, IFPA
Thanks. So Judy, please tell us about Fresh Texas.
Judy Clark, Fresh Texas
Sure. Thanks, Vonnie, for hosting this podcast. Fresh Texas is a value added produce supplier, we're located in San Antonio, Texas. And we also have a plant over in Austin, Texas. And what we do is we take in raw materials, commodities and other inclusions and we package them into something that the home cook doesn't have to spend a lot of time prepping. And so we like to think that we can make your mealtime a lot simpler, create a little healthier meals at home. Our forte is really in that meal solutions provider landscape along with the line of dips and your your normal fresh cut produce just vegetables and apples. Sorry, not apples with fruit.
Vonnie Estes, IFPA
So how far do you ship to? Is this all just in Texas? Or do you go outside of the state?
Judy Clark, Fresh Texas
Yeah, you know, for us, we focus really on high quality fresh products. And so we like to keep our shelf life somewhere in that five- to 10-day range depending on the commodity. And so for us, Texas is really our mainstay, but we go as far as Oklahoma, Louisiana.
Vonnie Estes, IFPA
Excellent. So I know both of your companies do a lot, many different things. But I think today and kind of where the overlap is is is looking at traceability. So, Julie, we'll start with you. Why is traceability so critical to the produce industry right now? And how does it impact the overall business today?
Julie Escobar, DiMuto
Sure, so the way I see it, Vonnie, there's two different angles, obviously from a retailer or consumer perspective, traceability is very important, because, you know, it really allows the companies and ultimately the consumers to really understand where the product is coming from have much more bigger self confidence that there's transparency in the supply chain. But on the other side from an investment perspective, as we see all of these huge companies and investment companies coming into the marketplace into the ag business, traceability and especially that the DiMuto platform is really going to bring a lot more visibility to what the actual farmer is doing on the ground. So when we talk about water consumption, fertilizers, you know, we talk a lot about nowadays about food waste, sustainability, ESG, you know, really having a traceability system in place to be able to track that data, It's hopefully you really what's going to help us all put all the data together and make better business decisions. So ultimately, that's why I think traceability all the way from the farm to the final. Right? It's so important.
Vonnie Estes, IFPA
Judy, what about your business, and how do you see the importance of traceability?
Judy Clark, Fresh Texas
Sure, it's a cornerstone of our business. You know, every day we're bringing in raw materials and packaging that has food content. We have to have not just full traceability but quick traceability. You know, this isn't the days when you'd go to a drawer and find paper and try to track that, we really need to build a run a quick report and know exactly where we use everything by lock code up and down through the supply chain. So it's exciting to us to hear about some of the new technology coming into the space, it's going to make us even more connected with our suppliers.
Vonnie Estes, IFPA
And food safety is such an important part of your business. How does traceability and these different traceability tools help you with food safety?
Judy Clark, Fresh Texas
Sure, so one its requirements, right, we have to be able to trace. And certainly as we look at the new FSMA, section 204 that potentially comes into play here in November, it's going to require for certain materials that we handle, you know, an even higher level of traceability and electronic traceability. And it's something that's going to force the hand across the industry, as we wrestled with, you know, how much do we automate those types of activities. So, think we're excited about thinking about a platform that extends throughout our entire operation? And again, up and down in that supply chain.
Vonnie Estes, IFPA
So Julie, how does DiMuto's platform capture this huge amount of data?
Julie Escobar, DiMuto
Yeah, well, excellent question. So are technologies really based on a simple QR code, basically, through the QR code that we either put in a box or the actual fruit, it allows us to really kind of track the amount of data happening in that in that particular shipment of the actual fruit. And we've added in the last couple of weeks, a couple of more things into our platform. One of them is the format, which is once again, it's an application, it's an app that we will be working with the agronomist or with a small medium farmers in where they can ultimately also start inputting a lot of the information that happens at the farm. And then once again, all of this data gets placed in one executive dashboard. And depending on who you are in the organization, whether you're the executive team or the agronomists team, it allows you to have right-on-point data that otherwise it would take you weeks and weeks to put together.
Vonnie Estes, IFPA
So what kind of farm data are you getting? Is it like harvest time? Or is it agronomic data? What kind of data are they putting in?
Julie Escobar, DiMuto
So yeah, so at this point, as we're launching the farm app, we're trying to find a middle point and where, once again, it's not overloaded of data, but it's a little bit more about once again, the things that the world are highly concerned about. So one of them is the water consumption, obviously, the harvest timing, the yields, the fertilizers, the transportation, right, so how long does it take, how much does it cost to actually move product from A to B to C, to D, and so on. The beauty of obviously, like, as you probably know better than I do, the beauty of a startup, is the ability to be able to be nimble and humble enough to go to this kind of treatment and adjust yourself to what the market is willing to give you as a form of data. Because once again, I mean growers are very busy doing their job as growers. So it's finding that middle point, but right now we feel like we have water, fertilizers, harvest, yield, are probably the top priorities that we're tracking.
Vonnie Estes, IFPA
So you'll eventually be probably not doing this yet. But you'd be able to use this information to do some amount of carbon footprint tracking are kind of understanding, you know, how much how sustainable people are growing and what the carbon impact is, is that kind of what you're looking towards?
Julie Escobar, DiMuto
Exactly. That is that is exactly where we're going. So, you know, with my investment background, and the years that I've been in the business, I mean, as I said, I think it's managing global ag projects and not, you know, talking about sustainability and food waste and water consumption. It's very fancy, but how do you really track that information? And there's not a lot of data or a lot of platforms out there who can actually put it all together. So we can ultimately, you know, everyone in the supply chain or in the executive teams of these companies, can actually make the right decisions and can inform their shareholders and stakeholders about, you know, what are we doing about water? Why are we growing this amount of product, what is the actual food that we have in our farms, and what kind of decisions can we actually make, to  make better decisions and to hopefully have a much better planet, which is ultimately what everyone is trying, We're all trying to target that.
Vonnie Estes, IFPA
Yeah. Judy, in your business, I mean, I hear a number of people kind of complain about, well, I've got like, all these apps and all this data, and I have to input this and put this here, and nothing really talks to each other. Are you seeing that the data gathering and the information is starting to be compatible with each other? And that you don't have to have a bunch of different systems? Or how how's that working in the business side?
Judy Clark, Fresh Texas
Yeah, yes and no. I mean, integration is something that you just want to avoid at all costs, if you can, once an interface is down we're trying to catch up and it's a lot of wasted effort, right? So we're looking to try to find those platforms that are cloud based, that are seamless, that can integrate and create a structure for us that we aren't doing redundant work, redundant data entry. I'm not as much concerned that it has to be one system, because I think we've gotten to a point with APIs and connectors where we can have multiple systems, but they need they need to really add value in the space that they're playing. Otherwise, it doesn't make sense to not be in the same system across the broader area of the business. And you know, what Julie talks about is just so exciting, right? For us to be able to go to customers with that type of sustainability data, that's going to become more and more important over time. And so I think the folks that are invested in that and really supporting that move towards sustainable practices, and not just saying we're doing it, but measuring it and monitoring it, is it we're gonna be able to monetize that at some point. I think it was three days ago that that was it Seville, Spain named a heatwave. It's the first time we've named a heatwave.
Vonnie Estes, IFPA
I didn't hear that, wow.
Judy Clark, Fresh Texas
Yeah, I mean, we live in a world that climate change is real. And so I think we all need to be focused on, you know, making sure we're doing what we can on the sustainability efforts. And the other piece that you know, Julie, as you talk about what the software is going to do, in our business, we package things when it's at the exact right space, right? And so to be able to have some of that data and the visual data from the farmers in an app, for our procurement team, who's amazing with this, and our QA team to be able to say, okay, this product, we're going to be able to pack that when it gets here on Thursday, but it's gonna get here Tuesday, we need to ripen it a little bit. I think of that aspect of just smoothing the operation, which, you know, ultimately, when you do things like that you can take cost out of an operation.
Vonnie Estes, IFPA
Yeah, Julie, you were talking about before, just on the finance side of it, as you're working with growers and working throughout the system, how do you kind of layer on different kinds of financial services and being able to help them financially as well?
Julie Escobar, DiMuto
Sure. So one of the realities that we we have seen around the world is that the regular banks have always been a little bit more concerned on lending to the ag business, obviously, for all of the risk that sits around that: climate, transportation, you know, all of these unknowns. I think that in the last probably the last five, seven years, you would definitely see countries with a bigger appetite in the banking system to open up the financial system and open up the terms and lending. Specifically for us, we see that our technology and our traceability system gives us the ability to have full visibility to what happens to the trade, to the shipments. And by being able to have that visibility within our platform, then we can turn around and then we can actually, you know, tell a bigger story to our investment community. So as we continue to raise, you know, we are being able to see what happens with that particular grower. The platform gives us the ability to show, you know, what percentage of claims do they have, what percentage of of bad fruit arrives to the final destination, we have full visibility to their cause to the farming side of things to post shipment. And so I think that once again, bringing and having that visibility is what's going to give the banking industry in the investment community, a much more self confidence that extending terms and extending capital to those growers is the way to go. And then luncheon with the marketplace. So it's not only the traceability of the finance, but it's ultimately, you know, how do we open up new markets for those customers, which ultimately impacts the total ROI. In reality now we know that a lot of the countries they tend to focus mostly in one or two markets, the European market or the North American market. But as our company is based in Singapore, and we're so stablished in the Asia Pacific Rim, then how do we start bringing more opportunities to these growers to open up these new markets in the Asia Pacific Rim, which at the end of the day, that's where, you know, half of the population of the world sits today. So it's very exciting that being able to put the three pieces together, how we can ultimately bring those opportunities to those growers.
Vonnie Estes, IFPA
Yeah, that is exciting. Judy, what do you see? It sounds like you're pretty integrated and using some of these tools. What do you see are the barriers? Are there partners that you work with that you wish they had more tools, so you were getting better data? And so what are some of the barriers of adoption of these types of tools?
Judy Clark, Fresh Texas
Yeah, I think it's really getting to the growers and the packinghouses grading stations and having those tools that are seamlessly connected, like we run a decent ERP system here. And so that's how we have our connectivity once things hit our dock. But upstream of that, there is no connectivity. And so that's the next piece that I'm really looking forward to and understanding how we can have more connectivity upstream to our suppliers on the way in. And then of course, the other side is almost equally as important. How do we have our customers have visibility to that? And how do we connect the consumers all the way back to the story of how that product that they're looking to purchase or consume was grown? And, you know, there's a few people out there doing that now with the QR codes. And we played with it with one item a couple of years ago, and it was pretty cool to see how many people are interested in scanning that and learning more about what they're consuming. So I think that's the possibility is as we move forward, how do you grow more consumption? And what we know is it contributes to a healthy lifestyle, which is fruits and vegetables. And we do that by connecting that farmer all the way down to that consumer using the tech.
Vonnie Estes, IFPA
Oh, that's so cool. So the consumers, did they do it in the store, or did they do it once they got home? Or did was it a purchasing decision?
Judy Clark, Fresh Texas
We don't know, we just threw a QR code on and said ""For more information about this..."" And so it was kind of a fun test, just through our website, looking at the hits that we got to see people, you know, you dabbled to try to figure out what where can you drive consumption, and it was interesting. So to me, it's connecting that personal story, I think is where you're going to really drive the sales and the repeat purchases.
Vonnie Estes, IFPA
And I think if we're looking to get some sort of premium for some of these products, where people are really paying attention to sustainability, and they need a little bit of a premium, that those stories are going to be important, you know, consumers that really care about that and can really trace it all the way back. That's very cool. So Julie, you've been part of the IFPA Fresh Catalyst, we had a great time at Immersion Week, you were a bright spot on that on that bus. And so tell us what you've learned and how being part of the accelerator has been.
Julie Escobar, DiMuto
I have to tell you, Vonnie, I think that the tech accelerator is probably one of the best initiatives that I've seen IFPA come around in the last couple of years. My experience has been incredible from, you know, the trip to California to working with Judy. And just kind of getting a little bit of her mentorship, on preparing to go and visit her and her facilities in the next couple of weeks. Yeah, having the ability to also network with other similar companies. As you know, the startup world is just, it has so many lows and highs that just being able to kind of share your experiences with other companies and just learning from their journeys, and it was just really phenomenal. So I am a big fan of this project. And hopefully I'll become the the spokesperson for it for the Latin America side of the business.
Vonnie Estes, IFPA
Yeah, that'd be really great to get some more companies in from Latin America, because we really are looking, you know, it's a global program. And this year, we did have a lot of companies from other countries, but not much from Latin America, so it'd be great for you to spread the word down there, because there's so much interesting technology going on.
Julie Escobar, DiMuto
Oh, there's just so much. And yeah, and then the exposure to visiting the companies here in the U.S. and understanding the challenges and, and the opportunities. I mean, I think that's the kind of detailed conversation, as as a startup, if you don't have those relationships and that network, it can take you years to really establish as opposed to being in this tech accelerator in a week, you get all of this condensed information. So once again, congratulations for what you guys are doing, for all the work your energy you're putting into this and very excited to be able to kind of hopefully, push it forward to to the Latin American world.
Vonnie Estes, IFPA
Great, thank you, I will take you up on that. So just wrapping up here, Judy, what are the three challenges in your business that you're looking for solutions to across, it doesn't have to be traceability. It can be anything, what are the challenges that you trying to solve?
Judy Clark, Fresh Texas
I can only pick three? Okay.
Vonnie Estes, IFPA
Your top three.
Judy Clark, Fresh Texas
Six months ago, I think when we were all together, I would have said labor. But that seems to be, you know, stabilizing a little bit, which is just a great place for us to be. You know, sustainability is one of the other areas that I think is a big challenge. And we use a lot of water, and water is required to make food safe products. And so I think that's something that we as a team here are really focused on is, you know, our commitment to creating more sustainable practice and creating that sustainability throughout the life of the supply chain. It's not just water usage, it's electric, you know, it's packaging, how do we have more sustainable packaging? So something that I think it's a challenge, and it's also, you know, a good journey for us to be on, really focused on that. You know, tech is another area, that is a challenge for us, right? We need to do more with scanning technology, and more with analytical technology that helps us drive better business decisions. There's so much tech out there. Now, to your point, Vonnie, earlier, you can get lost in bolting all of this together. And so we're at a bit of that point in our maturity where we're 40 years old, but you know, a company grows up on a system, and it takes a long time to start maturing into what's new and out there. So we're kind of undertaking that work right now. And that's, any tech change is always just a little bit scary. But we know it can make us much better at what we do. And that, you know, we touched on this as well, but you know, the other big challenge is climate change, right? We're coming out of the the hottest few months we've ever seen here in south Texas, and it's normally hot, but we're a refrigerated business. And so making sure that we're able to keep it temp when you've gotten extraordinary pressure on your facilities and your trucking, you know, when when the temperature never cools down at night, and it's hitting daily highs that are well above the ordinary. It's just, that is a challenge that I think, globally, we're all going to be addressing here in the coming months and making sure that we're really doing the right things to drive sustainable agricultural practices, processing practices, and then obviously, delivery and shipment practices.
Vonnie Estes, IFPA
Great. Just those? (laughs) So Julie, what are three problems that improve traceability tools, and actually just anything that you guys are working on, can solve for the produce industry?
Julie Escobar, DiMuto
Yeah. Well, I love where Judy was going with her responses. And obviously, we know that traceability is very good for food safety, and so on. But I really think that where we're thinking, the DiMuto's executive team, and how we see the opportunity of traceability, and bringing the finance and the marketplace together is similar. So from a sustainability perspective, I mean, the reality is, how do we walk the talk? I mean, how do we really bring data, compelling data, that is going to really force these companies to make the right decisions at the ground level? Which, once again, I feel that, you know, if you're an exporter in Colombia or Mexico today, and you are managing 1,000 small growers, you know, how do you manage that data today? It's so all over the place, it's just old-fashioned, people are still writing things on pieces of paper. So we really have to be able to bring digital tools to the small/medium farmers to be able to really start speaking sustainability. The second thing is, or third thing is, she's mentioned a Judy, that climate change, right, I mean, it's just a reality. I mean, it we see it every day, is going to continue to hit as harder. It's especially depending on the different countries that you source product from. So once again, bringing that that traceability system in place and being able to trace that data back is just once again going to help everyone in the supply chain to make better decisions. And then from a consumer perspective, there's just so much that happens at the ground level, you know, there's incredible stories of social impact and sustainability and really interesting things that the growers are doing. But not a lot of that a lot of that information, it just doesn't get passed to the consumer. So the ability as we were talking earlier, the ability to track and kind of scan it with your QR code immediately at the store level and being able to kind of immediately see it in your phone. Where's the farm located? What are they doing? What kind of interesting stories is the grower putting in the country to help their communities or to impact the planet? I think that that's really going to be a very interesting part of what we're trying to do with our with our traceability system.
Vonnie Estes, IFPA
Excellent. Well thank you both. And before we go, I want to thank two of our sponsors. We had a number of sponsors for the IFPA Fresh Field Catalyst accelerator that made it possible. And so two I want to thank today, one is Bolthouse Farms, which we visited on our Immersion Week, and Bolthouse believes in making better choices about how your food is grown and is committed to creating healthier products for its customers while improving soil health and reducing food waste. And Local Bounti is another one of our sponsors, and Local Bounti is changing the way leafy greens are grown and delivered from their farm to your kitchen. So with that, I thank you both and we will talk to you at another time.

Vonnie Estes, IFPA
Hello, I'm Vonnie Estes, your host of Fresh Takes on Tech. Welcome to our newest season in which we highlight companies in the Fresh Field Catalyst, an IFPA Accelerator. The accelerator is a six-month program bringing new technology into the produce industry. For more information on the accelerator, you can contact me or go to freshproduce.com. Today we are talking to Elon Mardix, the founder and CEO of Clarifruit, an Israeli based company that has a fresh produce QC platform. And as part of the cohort of this year's accelerator, he has invited a customer to join us in the conversation, Barbara Guerpillon, who is the Global Head of Dole Ventures from Singapore. Barbara's role is engaging with start-up companies to help Dole reach its goals. Clarifruit is one of those companies working with supply chain stakeholders on QC data to maximize profitability and reduce waste. I think you'll find both the technology and the partnership enlightening. Elad explain how you met Barbara, and what are you currently working on? How are you specifically engaged with Dole?
Elad Mardix, Clarifruit
Great, thank you Vonnie for inviting me. And thank you, Barbara and the Dole family supporting. So the relationship between Dole and ours actually started somewhere in 2020. When we were in and later stage of later stages of developing our AI powered quality control software. We've engaged with Dole late in 2020, and really rolled, rolled out this relationship in early 21. Through the partnership with their early-stage Sunshine Fund, which I'm sure Barbara's going to talk about later. With the goal to help Dole automate, the way they evaluate the quality of their produce categories along the entire supply chain. I think what drove it for both parties was Dole’s strong commitment to reduced waste, and make the entire supply chain management process much more efficient. And we bring a technology that we believe is going to be transformational to this industry, leveraging AI and some other software technologies. So we started really engaging with Dole on a pilot level in early 2021. We actually spent about four or five months with the team primarily in Singapore and Philippines, showcasing how the product works. And in mid-2021, actually, thr pilot was defined as successful and we move to commercial in the later stage, which we can talk about later.
Vonnie Estes, IFPA
Excellent, great. Barbara, how does Clarifruit fit into your business?
Barbara Guerpillon, Dole
We have made a very strong commitment to reduce our food loss to zero by 2025. And Clarifruit food technology helps us to reduce or improve our quality check and therefore reduce the waste that we are generating. But most importantly, I just declined to explain how we are looking at the importance of technology in in our business and why lamingtons really fit into what you're trying to do. The entire idea is to identify technology and partners that can help us to accelerate our transformation and deliver on our promise our six promises which is in short, our sustainability commitment. And we are starting we started this journey by recognizing that we cannot do it alone and acknowledging that we need external partners. So not only Clarifruit has brought to us a great technology but also a great team to work with. So, so far it has been a beautiful journey together.
Vonnie Estes, IFPA
And what are your plans for expansion? And are you looking at different crops now looking at different areas and different regions.
Barbara Guerpillon, Dole
So what our conventions are mainly based out of Southeast Asia, we have some patients in Thailand and Philippines. And we are looking at, we have four crops, bananas, pineapples, papaya. And today we are going to look at, we are looking at pineapple. And we are looking at expanding the use of clarity fruits within the pineapple business, but in other areas, but also outside of pineapple with bananas. And we need to take you through step by step. I mean, as much as we want to roll it out, you still have a lot of onboarding to do. And I would say a little bit of convincing as well. But the beauty is, as soon as the team understand the value actually guys up close, naturally the business on one interesting step that helped us to scale. Because this is the stage where we are now it's working with ASAP. ASAP helped us also to integrate the technology, we've been our work. So that contributed as well, a lot into the scalability of the solution.
Vonnie Estes, IFPA
Can you talk a little bit about how the teams engaged before we started recording this podcast? You were talking about having a meeting after this meeting with the teams talking to each other? And what is that like when you guys are spanning continents. And you started some of this during COVID? And just all these communication barriers? How did the teams work together? And is it big groups of teams? Or kind of how does that happen? Either one of you,
Barbara Guerpillon, Dole
Elad. But it's definitely a lot of holes. My role, as the head of venture for those sunshine company is to identify the technology and the teams to work with, and help them to connect with people in the business. So normally, and hopefully, we confirm the next step is really should be easier for him to roll out and expose the problem only once directly to the right people. And that's hopefully what we managed to do with that. And everything which is taking hold in I will be able to answer.
Elad Mardix, Clarifruit
Yeah, sure. So a couple of thoughts one. The car food software actually does not require an in-person attendance in order to deploy it at the client site. Now, from that perspective, actually COVID has been our friend. Yeah. Because, you know, it's one thing for me to tell that to Barbara and her team, it's a whole other thing for them to get comfortable with that. Now during COVID, honestly, our customers didn't have any choice, right, it was obvious that there's not going to be an in-person engagement. And so we were able to actually during 2021, deploy our software withdrawal, and a bunch of other customers with altogether almost about 600 inspectors in a totally remotely way. So we have not visited or seen those customers in order to deploy successfully our software, which I think is you know, it's a great testament to the ease of use of our software. But also, I think, kind of accelerating the shift on the customer side, that this can be actually performed very efficiently if the communication lines are, are open and consistent. I think the other thing that played out well, specifically with door for our perspective, was that the whole deployment process was very organized. There, signs project manager on the dole side, with incentive to make it successful in a specific timeframe. We have also devoted a specific project manager on our side. Both of those ladies connected very well and made this happen in the second half of 2021. And from that perspective, actually Dole sunshine is a model for us to how to do it successfully with all of our global customers.
Vonnie Estes, IFPA
That's great. Yeah, I'm sure that's it's not always the case that you've got a dedicated person who's incentivized to make it work because new technology can be so complicated to bring in. So What else have you been able to bring to dole that's different? What advantages have you brought to them?
Elad Mardix, Clarifruit
I think at the end of the day, it all goes, I always thought from the customer problems, pain points, right? Because at the end of the day, we were serving their pain points. And so the pain points that we have identified together with door where we're, you know, twofold. Number one toll did not have real time data with respect to the fresh produce quality, in order to optimize their decision-making process, right, they've already been performing quality control, obviously, without clarify, but it has been performed in a manual way, which is what the rest of the industry is still doing today. And so the access to data in real time was very limited. That's kind of point number one. Point number two is that the actual quality control process, the inspection process, that the inspector are performing throughout the entire supply chain, right, it could be at the field, it could be at the entrance of the packing house, or the departure of the packing house, and even at the destination markets, where it all actually does their own QC on behalf of their customers. It has been a manual process, where a human person is actually checking the size with sized wings and calipers and has a color palette in order to form with you on the color of the of the fruit, etc. And through our computer vision technology. We allow those to automate this inspection process by essentially using Cloud foods mobile app, through any smartphone device, by the way, and take pictures on the spot. And this technology essentially makes the inspection process objective and consistent, right. So it's not about what Vonnie thinks the quality of this pineapple on the west coast on Tuesday morning, or Barbara, five days later in Singapore, it's about what the machine thinks about the quality. And therefore it's going to be much more objective, and obviously much more consistent. So that's kind of that's addressing the second pain point I talked about. In the first point, which is access in real time to data, we obviously provide a cloud-based platform, which essentially allows the dole QC managers and inspectors wherever they are, they could be in the field or in the packing have complete an inspection in a couple of minutes, get access to a QC report with a grading immediately. And more importantly, get access to analytics that can help them optimize matching of quality of supply to customer specs. And that's really, you know, kind of the big data angle, which has been rolled out to a lot of other industries in the last, I would say eight to 10 years, but not so much to the agricultural supply chain. And through our platform, we essentially make it accessible to the fresh produce supply chain players.
Vonnie Estes, IFPA
Who are your other customers or types of customers that you work with and how it tell us a little bit about the company how big you are?
Elad Mardix, Clarifruit
Great. So Cloud food is it's actually a four year old startup. We're headquartered in Israel. Most of our employees are still in Israel, we have almost 30 employees today. Most of them are on our on the R&D side in Israel. But we actually operate globally today and have a local presence across the Americas Europe and now in Asia as well. We set up this company four years ago with one single goal, which is help the fresh produce supply chain reduce the waste across the entire supply chain. The way we do that, as I mentioned before, is by developing an AI based technology software that helps our customers automate the way they perform quality control. Now, at the end of the day, we believe that the only way to ultimately help the supply chain reduce waste is by deploying the software across the entire chain. Think about the grower on the upstream and down to the retailer at the downstream. We started actually with the largest marketing company or packer, she purchases us guys mostly and name it, which is where, for example, Dole Sunshine falls into this bucket. And the reason was that as we developed our computer vision technology, produce category by product category, for example, pineapple, we wanted to make sure that we are partnering with a design partner, who is a top three, you know, wholesaler or marketing company, right. So when I finished to develop my solution, with the Dole Sunshine help, and actually told us it and deployed commercially, I figured all the rest of the pineapple X odors or producers in the world would welcome that solution. So that has been our strategy. And so today, vast majority of our 25 customers are marketing companies such as dole sunshine. Some other names, they can mention some of the other leading brands in this industry, like Zespri on the kiwi side and San Lucar in Europe, and Pink Lady on the apple side and Mucci Farms in us and a bunch of other players globally. And that's how we really started, we are now actually have been expanding towards the downstream of the supply chain, and starting to partner with some of the bigger wholesalers and retailers, who by the way, perform their QC for fresh produce, in a very similar way to the way the marketing companies do it, the marketing company do it in much more detail, because they're experts on this product category. But the other guys in the supply chain do a very similar QC process. So our solution is highly applicable to all of them. And at the end of the day, we're also going to get obviously to the growers at the upstream of the supply chain. So end goal is to really standardize or help the supply chain standardize the way they evaluate quality across the supply chain, starting with the grower ending at the front store of the Walmart or the Marks & Spencer store. And hopefully, if everyone is going to be able to perform this QC with the Clarifruit app on any mobile device that they use, we're going to be able to help the supply chain reduce a lot of the quality mismatch that is taking place, and ultimately reduce the waste.
Vonnie Estes, IFPA
Great. So Barbara, just to you and your role and what you're working on. What are some of the areas that you are looking for in innovation?
Barbara Guerpillon, Dole
So a lot in a lot of different areas. The venturing team has been set up about two years ago with the clear objective or mandate to identify technology from the outside technology and partners from outside that can help us to accelerate our transformation. And beyond looking at three big areas which actually somehow overlaps. The first one is about identifying technology that will improve or align with our product innovation roadmaps with the big ambition to bring nutrition for all affordable, acceptable and equitable food for everyone. So you have a wide range of technology around nutrition ingredients, natural sweetener, natural preservatives that we'll be looking at. The second big area where the venture team plays is on our operation. We are vertically integrated, we own some of our foundations, and we have opportunities to look at technology from crop nutrition, health and protection of our crops, soil health, food safety, traceability, labor improvement, so any technology that can help us to digitalize and transform our operation to make us a stronger company. And the third area which is something very close to my heart, and I become very passionate about it, it's the technology that can help us to deliver our six promises. Back in 2019, we have made a very strong and bold commitment to deliver strong promises better for the people with accessible access to nutrition for 1 billion people by 2025. better for the planet where we're working towards zero food loss in our door drums. aiming for zero CPU based packaging by 2025, working toward zero net zero carbon emission in our own operation baseline 2030. And finally better for our stakeholders where we are continuously trying to positively impact our farmers and their communities and the people working for those companies. So six big promises to be delivered very soon, we won't be able to do it without the support and the help of companies like Tyson Foods and other startups moving towards entrepreneurs. So those are all the different areas that we are, we are looking at as long as it's technology driven, and the innovation really help us to move forward and sorry for the wrong answer.
Vonnie Estes, IFPA
No, that's, that's a huge mandate. That's really exciting. I see why there's so much to talk about. Elid had a question for you. We've been lucky to have you as one of our inaugural members of our Fresh Field Catalyst. And you've been part of the program this year, can you give people an idea of kind of how that's been and how that's been useful for you?
Elad Mardix, Clarifruit
Sure. So I think I see two key advantage values to gain through this, the IFPA Tech Accelerator program. I think the first one is access to a lot of perspectives and thoughts from some of the industry leaders, whether they are big buyers in the industry, whether they are retailers, or whether they are suppliers in this industry. And I think they shared they've been, we've only been doing it for I think three or four months now, right, Ronnie days, but we've already had some amazing conversations with people who shared their challenges. And more importantly, from our perspective, is how they think about technology, adoption of technology, and essentially, what do technology providers like startups or otherwise, how they should approach those players in order to facilitate essentially, a successful sale and deployment with these guys. And I think those perspectives are very unique. You know, usually, when I go and speak to a customer, it's hard to get these kinds of perspectives in first or even second meeting, because there's always the sales tension between the two parties. And so this program actually gives us this unique access to these insights. The second, the second big value for us, has been actually the on the road week that we spent with you and the team, I think about six or eight weeks ago, in in the West Coast. And that was an amazing way to open this program, get to meet in person, some of those players that I just talked about, but more importantly, actually go to go to their fields, go to the packing houses, go to the distribution center, see how things work out and speak to some of the people that actually do the daily work. And I think it gives great perspective on the existing challenges. It allowed me to expand my network, and think through some other opportunities that I didn't appreciate before. So I think it's a great program. I also think that as opposed to some other accelerator programs that exist in the overall tech market, you know, you and a team Vani are bringing real, tangible relationships with some of the leading players in the supply chain. And that's going to that's going to go a long way to all of the participants in this program. So thank you for that.
Vonnie Estes, IFPA
Great, thank you. That was it was I hadn't asked you that question before. So it's really nice to hear your thoughts there. And I think that's, that's a lot of what we think about is just really coming at this from a solution space, you know, what does our industry need and bringing in companies that have solutions and having discussions like that? And so, it's, it's been really interesting, and a lot of those companies that you visited, and that you've met through us are really appreciative, you know, because they get so many people knocking on their doors constantly. And so they've been really appreciative to us to FPGA for, for bringing a group in in this way where they have time to sit down kind of outside the sales cycle and really learn about the technology. So that's kind of gone both ways. You know, they've been really really appreciative of having that opportunity to. So thanks for that. So one last question each for each of you, Barbara, if you can kind of summarize what are three things that you want to invest in and kind of problems you want to find solutions for?
Barbara Guerpillon, Dole
That's a very, very tough question. I think what really keeps me awake at night is definitely our constant. Look for solution to reduce our carbon footprint and reduce our environmental impact. So solutions, which will be today called nature based solutions, solutions will help us to reduce and secretary to carbon footprint that were a meeting, or definitely one thing that we want to unlock. The second is around, again, the soil, if we have improved, we protect our soil and have healthier soil will have better product, therefore better nutrition for our consumers. And I think maybe the third area, it's more about looking at interesting ideas or business models that can really make the circular economy working. And improving how we can deliver back value to all our stakeholders within our entire supply chain. So that's an agree with you, it's a little bit vague, but it is something that we are struggling with, we have been in our ways, for example, we know what to do with this, we can send it to biogas can create energy, we can upcycle it is still a challenge for us to transport waste from one form to another before transformation. So we really haven't found the right approach or solution to those. I think that's that will be the three things. But frankly, there is a way more and depending on the view that may come up with different answers.
Vonnie Estes, IFPA
Great, thanks. And Elad, how about what are three things that you want people to know about Clarifruit?
Elad Mardix, Clarifruit
So I'd say the following number one. And we talked a little bit about it before, our software based solution is surprisingly, fairly easy to use, and relatively easy to deploy and actually doesn't require, you know, staff and teams on the ground spending hours and hours or weeks in order to deploy the software. So I think that's very important point for the potential listeners of this podcast, because people may think that, you know, this is going to be a big project, which involves a lot of in person and how do deployment, that's not going to be the case with Cloud foot. So fairly easy to use. Use case as well as deployment. Second point, which is probably the biggest challenge for most supply chain partners today is with technology adoption, it is based on what I hear from people is, is how, how compelling or how clear is the value that you're bringing, with your technology right to the customer. And I think that's something that we've been very focused on. And so when we engage with the customer, we essentially present a very clear ROI over the alternative, which is whatever they're doing today in order to perform a QC. And the good news is that I don't expect the customer to believe me, I'm actually happy to offer what we call a 30 day free trial to most of our customers. And in those 30 days in in this 30 day period, they actually have the opportunity to experience what we call the cloud foot magic, comparing it the way they do QC with Claro foods versus the alternative and actually come up with an ROI analysis, which is based on their own experience. And that's actually what we usually present together with the QC manager to the management of these customer after this career. So that's kind of point number two compelling ROI with the ability to actually experience or experience it on your own in a 30 day period without any cost And I think the last one I'll say is that we're working with the entire supply chain. I talked a little bit about the vision before, we do believe that the ultimate way to reduce waste in the fresh body supply chain is by standardizing the way quality is evaluated across the entire supply chain. We started with the marketing companies slash Packer shipper, the guy's kind of in the middle of the supply chain, we're going to be expanded into the downstream segments of this, ie retailers in the next couple of years. And after that, we will go upstream to the to the grower segment. But we're very excited about the opportunity. We just were in the finishing final touches of our a round, which we're going to announce soon, that's going to be a north of $10 million raise that we just successfully finished backed by a couple of big VCs. And we're going to expand globally including the US, Europe and Asia. And we're very excited to help this supply chain, reduce some of the wavelet taking place. And essentially creating a language that's going to allow all the participants speak the same language. That's really the goal.
Vonnie Estes, IFPA
Great, thanks. So Barbara, how can people get in touch with you, I'm sure there's all sorts of people listening that are convinced that they have a solution for you. So what's the best way for them to find you? You're on mute, somehow, you're on mute.
Barbara Guerpillon, Dole
I had an app. Sorry. Two years ago, we have created the sunshine for all funds, which is nothing but an investment fund is actually a fund dedicated to designing pilots between startups and old. It's a $2 million fund. And any startups can apply and submit their ideas and and present the ideas to us. You need to go on our website, those sunshine.com/partners or you can click on departments. But then scrolling down, you have a get in touch button. And that will basically lend directly into my mailbox. LinkedIn also works very well. There is no application data beginning or end it is really about being visible as getting to know you, and helping you to find the best people to talk with. Also, for the for the for the audience, people listening and started listening, it is happening that if your solution is either something we already have covered, or something which is too early for us to look at, we will definitely repeat that. So yeah, that's the best way. Great,
Vonnie Estes, IFPA
Thanks a lot. You're not hard to find. I don't think that what's the best way for people to get to you?
Elad Mardix, Clarifruit
Sure. So best would be actually to go to our website, www dot cloudy food.com. Actually, there is there is a button at the top right corner of this page, which says start a free trial. If you go there, you can register. And we have couple of questions that we're asking people. And if approved, you can actually go and experience the close with magic in a free trial, as I mentioned fairly quickly. So that will be the preferred way. I'm also happy for people or players in the industry who wants to learn more about our solution, they can reach out to me directly at a lot easier elad@clarifruit.com. And we're also going to be by the way, in the AFPA conference in Orlando and late October, we're going to have our own booth in the technology provider section. So really looking forward to seeing everyone there as well.
Vonnie Estes, IFPA
Great, thanks for that plug, I was going to do that to appreciate it. So thanks to both of you. It was really great. This is how technology gets adopted by you know having partnerships like this. So it's really exciting to hear how you're working with each other and and want to stay close and hear how this all goes. So thank you very much. So let me just close with observe that let me just close with thanking two of our sponsors. We had sponsors for the accelerator that companies that have really allowed us to do what we're doing with the accelerator and two of those that I want to recognize today. One is plenty and plenty is a leader in indoor vertical farming, which has produced amazing products both out of their South San Francisco farm and and are starting to produce products out of their competent farm and the other is produce Alliance which She is bringing innovation to procurement and category management in the fresh produce and food service. So thanks to both of those sponsors, and thanks to both of you and I will be seeing you soon. Thank you.

Some weeds produce 250,000 viable seeds per plant. When you’re an organic farmer caring for your soil and crops by hand, one weed can cause a huge problem!
So why do farmers go organic if it’s so difficult?
In this episode I talked to Russel Hamlin, General Manager at Grimmway Farms, about organic agriculture, the challenges of organic farming and why it’s so important. George Szczepanski, Director, Production, Supply Chain & Environmental Policy at International Fresh Produce Association joins us at the end of the episode to talk about the association and why organic farming is important to the industry, the environment and the consumer.

Some weeds produce 250,000 viable seeds per plant. When you’re an organic farmer caring for your soil and crops by hand, one weed can cause a huge problem!
So why do farmers go organic if it’s so difficult?
In the latest episode of Fresh Takes on Tech, Russel Hamlin, General Manager at Grimmway Farms, spoke about organic agriculture, the challenges of organic farming and why it’s so important. George Szczepanski, Director, Production, Supply Chain & Environmental Policy at International Fresh Produce Association also joined to talk about the association and why organic farming is important to the industry, the environment and the consumer.
We discussed:
Why Grimmway Farms believes strongly in organic farming
The challenges surrounding organic farming
The importance of soil health and maintenance in organic farming
Starting in organic
Organic farming is notoriously difficult. Yet, for many, the extra challenge is more than worth it.
Grimmway farms is one such company who have successfully made the difficult transition from conventional to organic practices for much of their crops — though, like any others who have made the transition to organic, this was not without its hurdles.
With deep roots in conventional practices, Grimmway is the largest conventional carrot producer in the world — in fact, the amount of carrots they produce yearly could stretch to the moon and back six times!
So, it may seem strange that a company seeing such success with its conventional approach would want to make the transition.
But in their quest to grow the best produce on the planet, they realized that if they could overcome the initial challenges, they could better provide consumers with the kind of produce they’re clamoring for. Though, it was admittedly a struggle in the early days.
The first challenge the company had to contend with was the three-year transition time it takes to convert land from conventional to organic.
“It takes three years for the soil systems to transform to the point where they can grow good organic crops — and if you rush the process, you prolong the problem.” —Russel Hamlin
During this time, while ensuring that the soil was made suitable for organic use, they were unable to use the land to grow their staple carrot crop — an attempt Russel calls “a disaster” — meaning that they were losing yield and, in the short-term, profit.
Since the only organic crop they had to begin with were carrots, they struggled to properly perform crop rotation as they sought to reinvigorate the soil with organic fertilizers. This meant they were stuck rotating with fallow land.
The issue there is that while that land isn’t growing anything, it still requires maintenance, resources — such as labor to remove weeds — that could have been utilized elsewhere.A worthwhile challengeEven once the soil stabilized and they began to get the hang of organic growing methods, the company had to learn new techniques to maintain yields to keep the venture profitable.
“Everything was a challenge in the beginning because organic farming is not easy to do.” —Russel Hamlin
There are three major, ongoing challenges Russel points to that any organic farm must contend with: labor, weeds and water.
Labor
For labor, labor is the biggest ongoing challenge in agriculture today in Russel’s opinion. The majority of Grimmways organic produce is hand- harvested. This means that, when there are weed issues in the field, they are pulled by hand.
There's a lot of hand labor involved in the production of organic vegetables. And the labor availability continues to be a challenge every year for most farmers.
Weeds
Weeds are a tremendous challenge in organic farming. Some weeds produce 250,000 viable seeds per plant — so even if you get rid of 95% of them, you still have a problem. And because weeds are pulled by hand, weeding issues and labor labor issues are connected.
Water
Everyone in the country has likely heard about the water issues in California — and they are a big deal. One of Grimmway’s biggest ongoing challenges in all of their farming operations has been water availability.
In certain areas and years, the cost of water can reach such high levels that they can’t justify growing crops in more arid regions. It’s a challenge Grimmway overcomes by spreading their growing operations — and, therefore, their risk — across multiple states.
The payoff
So, while all of this sounds like a headache, for Grimmway, it’s all worth it. Because, ultimately, once they’ve made the transition, the yields are comparable to those of conventional farming. Besides, in the end, they are providing consumers with the organic produce they demand.
And perhaps most importantly, Grimmway are feeding the people while also being good stewards of the land they are using to do so.
Organic is regenerative
In previous episodes, we’ve discussed the nuance between conventional, organic, vertical and regenerative farming.
But for Russel, he has a simple take on it — organic farming is regenerative farming.
“In my opinion, organic farming is regenerative, particularly when you consider the transition process from conventional to organic land. It’s about bringing us all back to a natural productive state — and that is absolutely regenerative.” —Russel Hamlin
One of the company’s goals is to ensure they make the best produce to feed the people as they can, while minimizing harm to the environment.
To that end, Russel contends that the organic practices the company utilizes in their operations — from the initial and ongoing efforts aimed at restoring soil health to avoiding use of harmful pesticides — are regenerative practices.
And while Russel thinks the regulations defining organic are sometimes a little too restrictive, ultimately, it’s another challenge he and everyone else at Grimmway are happy to put a little extra effort into overcoming if it means they can continue to provide the best produce to the most people.

In the latest episode of Fresh Takes on Tech, Shelby Layne, Director, ESG Hub at Bolthouse Farms, shares how she’s taking on the complicated ecosystem of regenerative agriculture.
Shelby’s in constant communication with growers to learn their take on farming in harmony with the land.
And most growers agree: Regenerative agriculture holds the most promise for a more sustainable future for food production.
But while it’s true that there is no universally agreed-upon definition, almost anyone in the industry will tell you “true” regenerative agriculture is always organic agriculture.
Yet, the ESG Hub’s research into regenerative includes both organic and conventional farming.
Why?
Agriculture feeds the population — and right now, the vast majority of what people consume is sourced through conventional agriculture.
That means, if you want to make the biggest impact possible, you can’t exclude conventional.
Agriculture is always innovating and finding creative new ways to support an ever-increasing population and that’s not going to change anytime soon.
The difference these days is that those innovations, more and more, center around doing so in a way that doesn’t just nourish the population, but also the environment that sustains it.
And that’s better for everyone.

Trust the Organic Labelw/ Kathleen Merrigan
The organic ecosystem is as varied and complex as the U.S landscape. The industry faces numerous challenges: consumer confusion around what organic means, input and product shortages in organic supply chains, competition from new environmental labels, and concern that some NOP rules are preventing the growth and innovation seen in other markets.
In a recent episode of Fresh Takes on Tech, Kathleen Merrigan, Executive Director and Professor at the Swette Center for Sustainable Food Systems Arizona State University and the Former Deputy Secretary of USDA, spoke about the complexity of organic and the potential for its future.
Kathleen covered:
The definition and standards for organic
The acceptance of biotechnology and genome technology in organic agriculture
How sustainable agriculture and vertical farming fit in
Organic defined
While most expect— and would understandably love — a simple, one-sentence definition to encompass the entire practice of organic agriculture, unfortunately, this can get complicated quickly.
This is a problem because, historically, pinning down the definition of “organic” has posed major challenges for the industry — and the relevant regulatory bodies.
Organic is… what it’s not?If you were to ask several people to define organic agricultural practices, chances are, the majority will define organic by what it isn’t.
They may respond that organic doesn’t use pesticides or genetic engineering — perhaps that it doesn’t use synthetic fertilizers, ionizing radiation or added hormones.
In short, many would give you a definition filled with absence claims.
This absence-based view of organic is common amongst consumers and a persistent feature in the messaging from both the industry and advocacy groups, precisely because it resonates with people.
For example, when Organic Voices, a leader in the organic field (if you’ll forgive the pun), tried to pin down what messaging resonated most with people with regards to organic, they found people overwhelmingly responded to the lack of pesticides.
A positive view of organicKathleen prefers to view organic through a lens of its active practices, rather than the things it doesn’t do.
She points to the many important components to organic agriculture that don’t command as much space in the headlines.
Practices like:
Crop rotation (the cornerstone of organic production)
The need for buffers when budding a stream
The need to ensure that production maintains biodiversity
Allowing ruminants access to pastures
The use of manure and the rules regulating its use
This view of organic is built upon the activities organic production engages in — and the rules governing how to perform these activities responsibly.
The regulatory componentWhether you are defining it by what is absent from its practices or what it actively does, organic production comes with a lot of rules.
And while many industries bemoan government regulations, when it comes to organic, most producers, consumers and advocacy groups are actually begging for consistent regulations for the industry.
The organic industry is begging to be regulated. They want these tough rules because they know their consumers want them to follow these tough rules.” — Kathleen Merrigan
Still, if pinning down a simple definition for organic is so challenging, it should probably come as no surprise that regulatory bodies have had a notoriously difficult time when codifying rules defining it from a legal perspective.
Currently, the Organic Trade Organization — a citizen advisory board recommending standards to the secretary of agriculture — may be the leading authority on what should legally define organic.
While some of what they have argued for has made it into the law books, many of their recommendations have been left on a proverbial shelf, still awaiting action from the USDA.
Ultimately, there is no universal government standard for organic, which means the industry is left to define itself. It’s why, currently, the community-generated organic label is still the gold star for consumers wishing to buy organic produce.
The role of modern biotechnology
While complexity may cause issues, simple definitions for organic allow very little room for exceptions, which can make the journey from theory to practice a rocky one.
The natural questionFor instance, organic agriculture is often defined as an all-natural, synthetic-free practice. While this is certainly usually true (and in line with the philosophical spirit) of organic, in practice, such a black-and-white view rarely survives contact with conditions on the ground.
Take the common organic practice of deterring insects from crops with pheromones rather than insecticides: In theory, the industry could gather enough insects that the miniscule amount of pheromones each produces could be used en masse… but, in practice, that would be prohibitively expensive, excessively difficult and, one imagines, a horrible experience for the insects involved.
Instead — and it may come as a shock to some organic enthusiasts — an artificial pheromone is manufactured and deployed, which is one of the few accepted uses of synthetics in the industry.
Likewise, on the other side, things like arsenic may be all-natural, but widespread use would wreak havoc on the environment (and has in the past).
Luckily, this is something recognized by regulatory bodies. For example: the National Organic Standards Board — an advisory board responsible for recommending a list of which materials should be approved or denied — retains the ability to make common-sense exceptions to the prohibition on synthetics.
Organic pioneersAnother issue posed by inflexible rules is that it may unintentionally paint organic as lacking innovation or even being a type of neo-Luddite movement.
But this couldn’t be further from the truth.
With so many self-imposed constraints, organic farmers have to find creative and innovative ways to continue to produce yields that will satisfy the ever-increasing demand for organic.
And this creativity doesn’t just benefit the organic sector — it’s a boon for agriculture as a whole.
""Organic farmers have had to be very creative research pioneers — and it has benefited all of American agriculture.”— Kathleen Merrigan
One example Kathleen points to is the practice of rotational grazing. This was originally pioneered by organic farmers, but it eventually became the standard nationwide because it was demonstrably more effective than the status quo.
Some other exciting organic innovations include the practice of herding cattle with drones and the development of a biofilm to delay fruit ripening and minimize food waste.
Organic farming benefits everyone.
Genome technologyOne area of biotech that organic standards have, historically, rigidly opposed is genetic engineering.
Yet, Kathleen concedes that there are promising opportunities offered by genome technology. She points to the organic community’s love for innovations like the Impossible Burger — made possible by genetic engineering — as an indication that the tide may be turning in this area.
The sustainability question
Ultimately, the organic community thrives because people — in ever-increasing numbers — are concerned about their contribution to the negative impacts their consumption has on the environment.
This rising eco-consciousness in consumers has led to a high demand for sustainability in agriculture and plenty of innovative solutions being proposed to help mitigate environmental threats like climate change.
One solution Kathleen says shows promise in this area is the practice of vertical farming, which offers a chance to transform urban areas into agricultural production centers. And while this may not yield enough produce to feed the entire population, it may offset some of the issues created by increasing urbanization and a decrease in available land — and likely improve economics and equity in agriculture.
After all, these are vital components to sustainability — or, as Kathleen so eloquently puts it:
“The three E's: environment, economics and equity — sustainability is a three-legged stool and each leg needs to be equally long if the stool is going to be stable.” — Kathleen Merrigan
Wrapping up
While organic may mean different things to consumers, producers, advocates and government bodies, there are certain core philosophies to the movement that most can agree on.
Organic is about feeding our population in a more responsible way, offsetting the negative impact our species has on the planet. It’s about finding creative and innovative methods for achieving this to ensure that everyone has safe access to food for generations to come.

Vonnie Estes, IFPAHello today, we have a special guest. we have Tamara. Tamara is the new as of April 1st director of sustainability at international fresh produce association. She comes to us with deep experience and knowledge in sustainability and environmental conservation.
She has worked across public private non-profit and academic organizations. She's no stranger to the produce industry. Having spent six years at Driscoll's in sustainability roles. Welcome to the podcast and welcome to IFPA.
Tamara Muruetagoiena, IFPAThank you. Thank you so much.
Vonnie Estes, IFPASo please say a little bit more about your background and how you ended up at IFPA.
Tamara Muruetagoiena, IFPASo my background, I am a full-blown sustainability professional, as you mentioned. I started my career 23 years ago. And, at that point I realized that I wanted to turn an obsession into a profession because this is all I could think about all the time. I think about the environment and our impact in.
In this planet and what legacy do we leave behind? And so that's how I built a whole career out of that. I, as you mentioned, I started in government. I started working at the European union, and, I moved on to becoming a scientist into academia and then. I worked my way on to the corporate world.
And now IFPA gives me this opportunity to look at broadly at the whole industry, an industry that I care so much about produce and floral. And so looking at all the companies, all the challenges and, but also all the opportunities and the wonderful work that people are doing and being able to lead the path and sustainability.
Vonnie Estes, IFPAo it's interesting. during that whole time of building your career, when you started there, It wasn't a career path and sustainability right there weren't jobs that said, you know, you're the head of sustainability. So it kinda explain how that happened. That, you know, you were working as something you were passionate about and then it became a job title. Like, what was that like? and how did that work?
Tamara Muruetagoiena, IFPAThat is a great question, because I think about it all the time. when I started, no, there was nothing, there was no sustainability title. There was, you know, more or less, there were some environmental professionals, but they were working on technical aspects of the environment. And so I started working on environmental policy, agriculture fisheries policy at the European union with always with an, an environmental lens to it.
But in government I felt that. We didn't go deep enough into the, into those areas into those subject matters. And so I thought, well, I want to be one of those experts that we sometimes hire and we ask them, you know, what is this? So I went to, I went back to school, I got another degree. And then I became a scientist and I worked in science for a number of years, doing my own science and working with other scientists to really.
I understand, better, the whole environmental world. and then I realized that for me personally, so I I'm trained as a, as an ecologist. And so that's my scientific background, but I also have an MBA and then those two together form corporate sustainability. And but early in the two thousands, it was the first time that you would see the title sustainability in companies. And now you could have a chief sustainability officer, which is truly amazing, in corporate, but also in academia and also in government, there's a person or a team that leads the whole work.
And that's something that. It was never done before. It was very much all over the place. I think we're still trying to find our fooding as professionals, because we're, we work in different areas, but I think there's more cohesion with time.
Vonnie Estes, IFPAYeah, I think it's our first guests in this series, Joel who is the founder of GreenBiz journal. And it was interesting. the, he has, over the years, like they have conferences with sustainability officers and we talked a lot about just the importance of having. Someone that's in charge of it, but also having it permeate through the whole organization.
And you're seeing that happening more to that. It's not just one person that's like hiding in the back office. It's actually, you know, something that companies are embracing and it's part of everything that they do. So it's been interesting for me to watch that evolution tell us about your role at IPA. I know you just started and, you're gonna make this role your own as you learn more about it, but what are you excited to do?
What do you see as your role? What, you know, what do you think you're stepping into here?
Tamara Muruetagoiena, IFPAI think that something that I can do in this role is that we have. many members in the association and a good number of them, they probably have a sustainability team and, some others don't, but they're probably focused on their company, their thing, and what they're doing, their challenges, but what we can bring.
This added value that we can bring to all of our members is to really understand the whole scope, to bring new technologies and bring new ideas, bring together thought leadership. so we can support the efforts that all these companies are doing already on their own or they're trying to do on their.
Vonnie Estes, IFPAYeah, I think it's. So important. And we certainly hear from members whenever we asked members, what are the top things that they care about? Sustainability is definitely near the top.
And so, bringing you on. Shows that the organization takes us very seriously and we see how important it is. And we really want someone dedicated to looking at this and helping these companies. As you said, you do what you do, what's in front of you. But the whole point of an association is to have the thought leadership.
And I think having you in this role is going to. Allow people to have someone to come to, to ask questions. And then also just you giving your view and what's possible for the industry.
Tamara Muruetagoiena, IFPAYeah, exactly. And I think that because we have a. Escape view that companies naturally do not have because they're more siloed in there. And inside their world, we provide that landscape view that is so powerful to them. And so, so enriching to all of them and bring them together to, to, to.
Vonnie Estes, IFPAAnd learn from each other, right.
Tamara Muruetagoiena, IFPALearn from each other. Exactly. Because sustainability is all about learning is all about continuous learning. You're always, continuous improvement and, and just being more aware of what your practice is.
Vonnie Estes, IFPASo how do you think about sustainability in the produce industry specifically? And I know. Just even within agriculture, we hear a lot of people talk about sustainability and it tends to be more focused on the row crops and what they're doing. So for our industry and produce in Florida, how do you think about sustainability and what are some of the differences?
Tamara Muruetagoiena, IFPAMostly is somewhat similar to the rest of the industry. but there, there are a couple of areas that are very distinct. so for example, the whole packaging area of sustainability is very much associated with produce row crops, you know, cereal and, others, do not have that challenge or less of that challenge.
Um, we're very challenged by, packaging. Another one is labor where very labor-intensive industry versus other agricultural industries. If you think of corn, you have one person with a machine, for acres and acres. And here in produce, I think that most people don't know that you have this field.
Pat with people who are picking the produce. And so, the labor and the people aspect of the industry is really important. everything else I think it's shared, across industry. So the work that we do around carbon or climate change, Water waste or energy, or soil management. That's, you know, we'll have to do that work and they're all we'll have impacts there, but I think that labor and packaging makes us very unique.
Vonnie Estes, IFPANo, those are excellent points. I hadn't thought of those two specifically, but yeah, when you look at so many things that we grow end up in a package, because if they weren't in a package, then you'd have more food waste. And so you're balancing off these, you know, two different things that we have to deal with food waste and plastic, and there's a lot of work and it's where.
You, and my world's kind of intersect, you know, there's a lot of work looking at the technology of what, what can we do to improve this, to have less plastic and continue to have less food waste. And then the labor issue, as you say is just huge. And we're, you know, we're looking at different ways to automate and help and use less labor and have labor do less difficult tasks.
But as you say, it's very different in a field of produce than it is corn. So, it's a constant. So, can you tell us, how the produce industry is adopting some of the sustainable practices? just what you've seen in your career and looking specifically at produce, give some examples of, what companies are doing, in the sustainability area.
Tamara Muruetagoiena, IFPAWell, I have to say that in my view, across the industry, They were very shy about what they do. they think they don't do much, and I think they do more than they think they do in general. And so they're not about showing off for the most part. So you have to pull it out of each company to understand what they're doing because they're not talking constantly about, oh, I do this and do that mostly because produce is a brand.
World for the most part, there are some brands that are easily recognized by people, but for the most part produce is just, you know, huge category with no brands. Whereas the brand world, they love to show cast sustainability. They're constantly talking about sustainability. But in produce, you have to pull it out of them, but the association has done a good job at that and creating some case studies.
So, you know, some, some members can learn from what others are doing in, in that area. I'm constantly blown away by how creative they all are. with sustainability and I've seen some incredible things and I can't, I don't like to pick favorites, but I want to, you know, highlight some cause I think they're all wonderful.
And they'll try. And so, just a couple of examples that either I have seen, or there are found unusual, one of them in it's, luminary. In California, well is bigger than in California, but in their headquarters in California, they have, they started this solar farm and they have created this whole strategy to be completely, energies sufficient.
And so that's their whole LoDo and that has been really powerful. And they've been very driven in that space. and no matter where they grow, they keep that strategy. another good example is, a company that I came across reading about them in South Africa, CZ , and I think they have such a catchy name too. and they. They are really focused on an ecosystem approach to farming and, ecosystem and precision farming all at the same time, that very mindful of what the impacts they have, but also how doing precise, farming, which is truly incredible. their original focus was soil health. And having good soils.
And so they started doing this incredible composting program themselves because they couldn't access compost from other sources to amend the soil, create healthy soils. reduce them on a water they used and et cetera. And that's really a powerful.
Vonnie Estes, IFPAI think it's interesting what you said at the beginning that, People are kind of shy about what they do or you have to kind of pull it out of them. And they probably wouldn't say here are all of my sustainable practices and here are my other practices. So part of it is just even defining. And I think, you know, some of the case studies that, that.
Has worked on is really kind of going to people and helping them uncover, like this is a sustainable practice. And I think that's part of what your role will be as well as just helping people see the great stuff they're already doing and kind of showcasing that. And having people share with each.
Tamara Muruetagoiena, IFPARight. Yeah. I mean, many of them have not embedded sustainability into their, strategy, you know, corporate strategy, you know, it's just something that they do, but they do it. And so because of that, I think that. yeah, it's important to us to get it out of them because they're really making an effort.
Vonnie Estes, IFPASo what role does policy and regulation play in the adoption of sustainable practices and the produce industry?
Tamara Muruetagoiena, IFPAWell, I think, that is a huge, I think a driver for sustainability, Sometimes a little old fashioned because everything that comes from government comes the law a few years behind other trends, but it's true that, re whereas, well, this is a little hard to, you know, it's hard because sometimes, the regulators have come with restrictions for, farming practices that have.
Being seen by the industry as restriction of their, or limitation of their tools in their toolbox and really, limiting or, their yields, making everything more expensive, more costly, more, more complex. But I think that the government has come. Of course with good intentions. And so I think what the struggle is to just put the two together, there's also quite a bit of requirements coming from retailers.
So there, the industry is being asked by not only the policy world, but also the retailers on their practices. So I think that in many of. Many of the companies are small and it could be really overwhelming to them. so I think that, It's important that government needs to understand that they need help.
They need a little bit of holding hands until they really can report what they're doing or limit what they are or changing their practices, et cetera. very much like it happened with, with food safety in the past, that is food safety in terms of regulations and compliance. I don't know, maybe 15 years ahead of sustainability. and they have more or less their act together. I think, whereas in sustainability is a little harder, cause it comes from different places and different, different requirements. Sometimes there could be water requirements. Sometimes they could be about, fertilizer use pesticides for sure. It et cetera.
So it's, it comes from very different places. And also, it varies by region. So some of the requirements are federal. Some of them are state some of the companies, pro produce in different states. So it's hard for them to adapt to the requirements in one versus the other, and then their supply chains.
I think it's good and it's driving the industry in the right direction, but it's hard to comply with sometimes.
Vonnie Estes, IFPAYeah, it's certainly imperfect. And then you add in global on top of that and when people are trying to ship things out of the country, and I think with a lot of these regulations, what ends up happening is the producer ends up having to bear the cost and take on the risk of. Adopting new practices.
And so I think that's tough. So it is I'd love to see ways where, and I think the USDA is trying to help and, you know, putting money and doing grants and, you know, trying to help and not having industry bear all the risk, but I it's difficult. Cause everyone, everyone wants this, but someone has to pay for it. Right. Cause it is many times more costly to transition into new types of practices. So yeah.
Tamara Muruetagoiena, IFPABecause, in the produce industry except for organically grown. So, USDA organic, there's not a price hike for organic, for sustainable practices. So you've written the cost. You might have a wonderful story to tell on your website, but you know, people are not going to pay more for you. And so, or I mean, sometimes they might, but it's not a given, so it's a little tough for the industry.
Vonnie Estes, IFPAI think that's, I wanted to talk next about some of the things that are slowing down the adoption of sustainable practices. And I think that's certainly one of them is that it, some of these practice costs more, but you don't make any more money. And so that's definitely a barrier. Are there other barriers that you see that kind of slow down adoption?
Tamara Muruetagoiena, IFPAI think that, well I think the nature of the industry, and the plants themselves and how, you know, susceptible they are to weather changes. That for example, that's, that's that CR that creates a lot of stress in the industry, you know, weather issues or pest outbreaks. and, or, you know, they're having supply chain issues or food safety issues or labor shortages, and you're trying to do something else, but then you have this, you know, bigger fish to fry.
Cause you know, you might not even make it to market. And so you might have to leave your sustainability practices aside or tame them a little bit because all of these external. Factors. it's yeah, so fresh produce and flowers are so sensitive to so many changes. external factors that, are really hard to control and that it's could be a huge competitor for, you know, the good work they want to do in sustainability.
Vonnie Estes, IFPASo my last question, what are three things that companies in the produce industry can do to be more sustainable the world? According to Tamara?
Tamara Muruetagoiena, IFPAThings, the world, according to Samar, well, you know, three things that they can do themselves. I mean, many of the things that they could do are dependent on others. So if I'm not gonna say packaging, because it depends on, do you have the right products, et cetera. So don't things that they could do on day one and.
Um, so one of them is, there's the source of their energy. They can, purchase, renewable energy. that's a powerful and strong one. And if they can invest in renewable energy in their operations also, that's one thing that they could do themselves. and it's very important for our work on climate change.
The other one is, I highly recommend every operation to hire, or to contract, integrated pest management expert because, that person or that group could see, could take a good look at the operation and their practices and truly help. Most efficient, pesticide use and pest management in general with different practices.
So that's another one and the third one, and this is a big one. I also think that companies should, invest, trained. There are people in the field in, plant nutrition. So, you know, efficient use of fertilizer because, if you know, efficiently use, you know, use better your fertilizer or you are not only being more sustainable by your cutting costs at the same time, but in my view, you know, ideal view of the world, what I would really love to see in the area for licensure.
Compost being more cost-effective organic third fertilizer to being most more cost-effective because now, it's a price hike for four producers, but, the environmental impacts of it, are significant. And so, yeah, that's my kind of wished for the future.
Vonnie Estes, IFPAYeah, and I think that as we know things going on in the world right now, that's only going to get worse and having availability of fertilizer and the cost is going to continue to go up. And, I know organic growers are really looking for. Sources and different ways to have fertilizer. And so I think there's a number of different technologies that are trying to figure out how do we get, you know, more nutrition in the soil in a better way.
That's better for the environment. So I'm with you on that one. Well, I agree with all three of those are great. Well, thank you so much for your time today. And, I'm lucky that I'm going to get to talk to you frequently. So I look forward to working together and, thanks for your time.
Tamara Muruetagoiena, IFPAWell, thank you so much for inviting me. This is, I feel really honored to already speak, you know, speak my voice, through this PO podcasts. Thank you. And I also look forward to working with.
Vonnie Estes, IFPAThanks. So with that discussion, that ends our season focused on sustainability. After a short recess of a couple of weeks, we'll come back with the season, teasing out the differences and similarities between produce that has an organic label. Is grown using regenerative practices and, or has grown in a greenhouse server vertical farm.
So I'm really excited about this topic. This is a journey that I personally want to go on to try to understand these differences and what it means to consumers. so we'll look at what's better for you. What's better for the planet and where technology can have an impact in these different ways of producing food. So thank you and see you soon.

Vonnie Estes, IFPAHello and welcome back to fresh takes on tech. We're continuing our season on sustainability and today we are going to talk to Bill or it's about bio products and reducing plastics in the food supply chain. Bill is Research Leader at the USDA Agricultural Research Service in Albany, California. As Research Leader in the bio products Research Unit, Bill leads a 41-member team 13 PhDs of chemists, molecular biologists, plant physiologist, biologists and engineers working on a dizzying array of products and technologies. Hi, Bill, and welcome to the show.
Bill Orts, USDA-ARSThank you glad to be here,
Vonnie Estes, IFPAPlease tell us a little bit more about your work and the mandate that you have.
Bill Orts, USDA-ARSSo, we have three mandates, the primary mandate is to add as much value to agricultural co products as possible. And that has essentially three titles. One is zero waste initiative. So, any biomass source that isn't utilized optimally, we try to add value to the second one is our bio products initiative work with companies. And it's really close to the zero-waste initiative, but in adding value, end up with CO products that people sell. So, it's not just maybe optimizing what you would do with the almond hole, but turning it into a plastic or a composite or something. And then the third initiative we have is strategic crops. So, crops that haven't necessarily taken off that we want to develop like a domestic rubber supply.
Vonnie Estes, IFPAGreat. So, one of the things that you've been heavily involved in, as you say, is developing prototypes for green packaging and sustainable materials. So, let's start by understanding the role that plastic plays in the food supply chain. Can you explain why we use so much
Bill Orts, USDA-ARSWe use a lot of plastic because plastic works. I know that it that's not necessarily intuitive, but it's a remarkable material developed over the last 75 years. And you get clear films, you get solid trays, you use a minimal amount of material to get produce, get your stuff to market, and you get it. They're sterile, so clean and predictable. So, we use a lot of plastic because it has a lot of uses. It's very versatile. And its good material that essentially works. It does leave an environmental footprint. But all things do.
Vonnie Estes, IFPASo, what are some of the negatives of using so much plastics in the chain? So, it's just the what's the environmental, the negative environmental footprint look like?
Bill Orts, USDA-ARSWell, the first questionable impact is the source of plastics is from the petroleum fossil fuel industry. So that's generally the feedstock. And so, it's not necessarily sustainable. And you know, we produce oil and oil, a lot of that goes into plastics. The second one is the end of life. What are you doing with the plastic after it's done? So, for many times, we use, say plastics for single use, you might have a, you know, to our relationship with this plastic, I mean, for a cup, it could be a 20 minute relationship, and then it's going to go to a landfill and may never degrade. And when it does degrade, it degrades slowly that degrades into methane and greenhouse gases.
Vonnie Estes, IFPAAnd has this become worse during COVID.
Bill Orts, USDA-ARSThere's a lot more takeout food delivery items, single use items. So, it hasn't necessarily gotten better during COVID. And then. Yeah, I mean, people are shopping for individual portions. So just I don't know if it's COVID. But more generically, we buy smaller items, and single packaging. And so often, you have a lot more packaging relative to the amount of food you bought. Mm hmm.
Vonnie Estes, IFPASo, there's a number of ways to attack using less plastics in the food chain, you've your work over the decades has had a huge impact. Let's talk about some of the areas you've worked in and some specific examples of that.
Bill Orts, USDA-ARSSo really early on, we didn't necessarily want to make the decision whether you should go for biodegradable plastics when they're single use or really focused on recycling. And we've done both. So, you know, I know it's not necessarily the role of USDA to help companies recycle plastics, but we've gotten heavily involved in what's the best use of recycled plastics. So that's what we do with 1/3 You know, part of our initiative. The part that's a little more noticeable is the company the companies we've worked with to make degradable plastics and composites. So, these are the source of the carbons for The plastic are from the ag industry usually. So, things like poly lactic acid you get from Cargill, down natureWorks whatever the companies were now it's called Ingeo. So, you take sugars converted to lactic acid make poly lactic acid. So, it's just a sustainable source of a plastic. And then you make it into a material we can use as packaging, or as a copper Single Use Item. Those plastics are by definition degradable as well. So, you have plastics that are sustainable. So, there's different words here, sustainable source, and then degradable and then compostable. Not necessarily one in the same, you can have synthetic plastics from petroleum feedstocks, which aren't necessarily as sustainable upfront, but they can be biodegradable, compostable at the end of life. So, we've worked on all areas with different companies. And so, you know, the devils in the details on this one, we find that single use items are best if you know their end of life. So, a lot of times they're best at a restaurant or a shop where you know what you're going to do with the material at the end of its life. So, a good example is that a cafeteria, if everything in that cafeteria is compostable, and you get it into a compost bin, you have a really good idea of what's going to happen at the end of life.
Vonnie Estes, IFPASo, on the compostable, what do you what do you do with that? I mean, I'm always confused just in my own house. And so that goes into my compost bin, and then that will break down and compost is that that's what happens with that.
Bill Orts, USDA-ARSSo, if it's a kind of a clamshell or a plate, and you know, it's compostable, and it's been well labeled, there's less confusion. The confusion arises when a plastic fork or knife or even a clear cup is not well labeled. And you don't know what to do with that. So, should that go in the recycle bin? Or should it go in the compost bin? And if you've been well educated, you read the bottom and you say, okay, if this is made of PLA, it goes into the compost bin, but it is a source of confusion. So, it's not you've asked the underbelly of a question that the nasty question and all this, how do we educate consumers to know when they have a compostable and when they don't?
Vonnie Estes, IFPAAnd is there an answer to that? We do.
Bill Orts, USDA-ARSAgain, the answer is like on things like clam shells or even certain trays and you know, you know, there's sometimes a little earthier looking or Browner and you have big label on the bottom. This is compostable, people are getting used to it. Again, if you're at a cafeteria where everything in you knows everything going in and going out is compostable, we get used to it. But you know, if a fork is not labeled really big and big letters compostable on somewhere on it, what do you do with it? You don't necessarily know.
Vonnie Estes, IFPAAnd then what does it break down to? I mean, the actual like composition chemical composition, like yeah, just disappear or what's left of it.
Bill Orts, USDA-ARSAlright, so to call it compostable it has to meet an ASTM standard. And we've been involved in developing those standards like what is called ASTM D 6400. Was one of the first ones what is a degradable compostable plastic, what is its definition? It has to break down at a certain time at a certain temperature to basically co2 co you know, just basic carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide hydrogens, basic materials, so it can't leave behind any remnants of the original polymer.
Vonnie Estes, IFPAHmm, okay. And then degradable explain that and how that's different. Yeah, so
Bill Orts, USDA-ARSWell. So as compostable is a tighter definition if you have a compostable standard and you go to an industrial compost facility, degradable starts to use words like home degradable when ASTM is trying to put a standard on that but then consumers want to just put it out in their backyard compost bin and hope it degrades. And so, degradable has fuzzier definition sometimes and biodegradable right? It means something to different people. So, one of one of the standards we you know, we kind of cringe at is home compostable because everybody's home is different. compostable industrial compostable, okay, we say okay, there's a standard there's a standard temperature. So degradable is in the eyes of the beholder sometimes, but so compostable degradable, we like to think of ASTM standards, what is biodegradable at a certain temperature going to break down two elements we can predict, you know, small molecules
Vonnie Estes, IFPAAnd then recyclable. Let's talk a little bit about that. So, what is what work? Have you done there? And what are the different ways that people are recycling these types of materials?
Bill Orts, USDA-ARSYeah, so for the past 20 years, we've been working with landfills and trying to find ways. So, we don't recycle as well, as we think we do. You know, it's really only 25 to 40% recycling of plastics, it can be done in larger places, like arenas and cafeterias, you can get it all or did it get none. But we've been working with landfills, to where we tried to help them screen out bottles and cans, and plastics. That didn't make it into your blue bit. Alright, so we've worked with several Recology in San Francisco, and Salinas Valley, Solid Waste Management Board, and work with them to screen out any plastic that didn't get caught in your red in your blue bin. And then the second thing is about four or five years ago, we used to be able to send all our plastics from those recycle bins to Asia, and most of the Asian market stopped taking our recycled plastics. So, we've been working, we have a pretty significant grant with CalRecycle, to find new uses for that recycle plastic that used to go to Asia, but we want to use in this country. So you can imagine it's, you know, every different color, clear and green, and all these different, you know, plastic bottles that you see on lids have bottles, they can be blue milk, milk carton reds, we put them together, and we try to put out plastics that have as close to the original properties of the plastics as possible. So, we got a pretty significant grant with CalRecycle. That's California's Waste Management Board, if you will, to optimize the reuse of plastics, take that recycle plastic that you get, and, and so they have these material recycling facilities, you pull out these plastic bottles and cans, plastic bottles and wraps. And you put them together and you blend them into a plastic that can be used, say for lumber, or reused in carpeting, textiles and such. I'll add one more thing we're part of the Zero Waste initiative, we have mostly you've got to get it to a uniform color. Right. One way to get it to uniform color is to add carbon black, Carbon Black is the black, you know powder that makes your tires black. Well, we've discovered that one of the best sources of natural Carbon Black is to take things like almond shells, and walnut shells, make charcoal out of it, grind it up and use that as a substitute for carbon black. Hmm. And the advantage of that is it didn't just show up as an inert filler, it added heat stability to that recycled plastic. So, you take recycled plastic, that could be a really weird color, probably blobby Gray, you add carbon black, which is basically charcoal you've made from almond shells, grind it up as a carbon black substitute, and you end up with a plastic that is more stable than when you started. And so, as you recycle plastic, you don't really recycle usually down cycle, it doesn't maintain the same molecular weight doesn't maintain the same heat stability. And so, in down cycling, you have to add more to make it more heat stable. If you can increase the heat stability, you can use more recycle in your mix, or write or make your pieces thinner. So, it's things we've been working on for the past 15 years, adding heat stability to recycle plastic, adding heat stability to sustainable plastics as well that biodegradable, need to have an array of properties. Vonnie Estes, IPFA So, what new technology or what new breakthroughs need to happen to make that work better or to just in kind of the technical side of it?
Bill Orts, USDA-ARSOkay, it's always about price point. The, you're working with the petroleum industry in the development of plastics is a very mature industry. You know, trillions of dollars have been spent on the supply chain with petroleum. And they're very good at making plastics very efficiently at large scale. And then we try to compete when our biomass sources aren't necessarily at the same scale as the petroleum market. And so are technologies have trouble matching the price point of polypropylene that came in maybe from wherever the Middle East or whatever, polypropylene at 65 cents a pound, and you're trying to do it from, you know, a seasonal supply of a crop or from sugar even, which goes up and down with food supply demands, right. So, you know, some of these sustainable plastics we talked about are fermented from sugars and or you're going to use a say iLASIK biomass source that is seasonal and is not necessarily coming in at the scale that the petroleum industry deals with. And so, they have a 75 year petroleum industry, I'm making plastic, they make good products, they have a 75 year Headstart, and they have the advantage of scale and consistency over the last 75 years, so we try to match their price points, with products that don't have the supply chain set up at that level. That's the biggest, I think the biggest because we can match the properties in general, but we don't necessarily match the properties at the same price point yet. Vonnie Estes, IPFA Hmm. And so, you were talking about working on some alternative crops, there are those crops that you would use as feedstock. And how's that work going?
Bill Orts, USDA-ARSYeah, so one crop that we're kind of proud of is making a domestic rubber supply using a crop called wildly, it's a desert shrub. And instead of, you know, tapping a rubber tree in the tropics, which is very labor intensive, and then the rubber comes, you know, 20 30,000 miles to our port, we would grow a desert shrub. And instead of tapping, it's, you know, got a certain percentage of rubber five 7%, say, and you would grind up the shrub, get your rubber supply, and then regrow that bush. So, it's, it's so it can be highly mechanized, it's kind of like mowing the grass and getting a rubber supply. We work with the big tire companies, and you can now buy Cooper tire, you can buy a domestically produced tire made from widely. So, it's past the state wall, it's out there. So is it Vonnie Estes, IPFA Price effective? I mean, can you, do it? Okay.
Bill Orts, USDA-ARSVery small farms, you know, but it is a desert Trump. But you're going to change the labor paradigm. And you're going to have a domestic source of rubber. And you can't make a jet tire without natural rubber. We know how to make synthetic rubber. But it's not exactly the same. It doesn't crosslink the same. There's something about it. And so, we're trying to help. Now, when you produce that rubber membrane, I just said it's about five to 7% maybe rubber in there, what do you do with the other 90x percent. And what you do with it, is you can make fibers from it, or you can ferment it into things like biofuels or plastics.
Vonnie Estes, IFPAAnd thinking about the produce industry, again, and some of the plastic use there. I know you've done some interesting work on just using helping with food waste, reducing food waste, the work you did with apple slices, and then I know you've also looked at some edible films. And so, what are some other things that we can do to just use less plastic and reduce food waste in the in this food chain?
Bill Orts, USDA-ARSSo recently, we have noticed that there's a regulation in Europe so let me mention price or produce lookup stickers depending on where you look. They're either called PL use price lookup stickers, are those ubiquitous little stickers that you see on produce, you know, as you as you walk through your produce aisle, they save a lot of plastic. Yeah. If because otherwise, your apples would be individually wrapped or you know, wrapped in small packages, you would use some kind of probably plastic tray or cardboard tray with some clear plastic over the top. But if by using those little stickers, you have the freedom to pick your own Apple pick your own produce. And it really says times at checkout. So, each one has a sticker, and then the cashier can quickly ring it up. And you know you can control your inventory. So those little stickers save a lot of plastic. There's a rule that the French government is basically said that by the end of the year, all those PLU stickers have to be home compostable, so it's that home degradable home compostable idea, so it has to meet a standard for breaking down. So, we see as a challenge and we are working with the leaders of the industry. To address that question. We need to be able to make a sticker with our partners. I mean, we provide ideas and some technology actually we live vicariously through industry partners that actually make it happen. But we're working with the leaders. You know, the leader in the PLU market is Sinclair is one leader that we're working with. They provide the PLU stickers that is widely seen. We're trying to get a sticker that is home compostable with a food safe adhesive that would also come post and meet the European standards. It's a charge. It's a big charge. It's a fun challenge. Again, we think and no we can do it. It's about price points. We're used to plastic sheets that are fairly inexpensive to produce and have been optimized for the for the past 40 years. So, they take on ink. Now remember, you have to be able to print on these really well and you don't want the ink to run, and you don't want the adhesive to come off in a freezer and things like that, you know, hot and cold cycles. So, it's, it's challenging, it's fun, you know, keeping coming to work every day.
Vonnie Estes, IFPASo, you have adhesive, the plant the material itself, and ink and all three of those have to be home compostable.
Bill Orts, USDA-ARSSo, what food safe so what? Plastic right? Yes, it's another, you know, some people treat them like, you know, they're those little ubiquitous things and they can be irritating to some they save a lot of supply chain issues and a lot of plastic wrap.
Vonnie Estes, IFPASo where are you in the process of finding something that works there?
Bill Orts, USDA-ARSWe are, well, again, working with Sinclair and other industry leaders, we are testing we have the equipment. So, for the past 20 years, we helped establish some of the ASTM standards for degree edibles. So, we work with other companies in plastics. There was a big wave about five years ago not only to be compostable, but to be ocean safe and ocean compostable. So, we work with companies to make sure their ingredients when they land in the waste in the water system. Are Water compostable. So now that sounds almost trivial, but it's not so when you send to a compost facility, there's a lot of microbes available nitrogen sources, when you get to the ocean, you might not have the same nitrogen and mineral composition that you'd have in the soil. So, plastic that compost at a compost facility or landfill, plastic might not break down in the ocean. So where are we audit? We're testing materials on those PLU stickers that are home compostable, and food safe and eventually going to be ocean compostable, fully degradable and meet the standard that the European market is asking for.
Vonnie Estes, IFPADo you think the US is going to follow with that requirement?
Bill Orts, USDA-ARSWell, I'll back up a little. I think, often in the EU, one country is like the canary in the coal mine. And they see you know, they'll come up with a legislation and they see if others if it makes sense in one country, sometimes it's an EU standard. Now that would affect a lot of export markets for the US. So, we'll start there. So even though it starts with France, and maybe a limited number of produce items, France may be a warning to get ahead of this thing. And it might be EU wide, within five years, the US tends to be a little more reluctant to put in federal regulations on these things, to mandate it as quickly. So, I don't think it's an immediate concern in the US. But if it's successful, it could be a concern soon enough.
Vonnie Estes, IFPABut if we're exporting, say, we're exporting apples, then we'd have to meet that mandate, when we are exporting from the US to France,
Bill Orts, USDA-ARSWe'd have to meet the mandate to export. And then once you do something like that, it's a lot easier to do it to your entire supply.
Vonnie Estes, IFPAExactly. Yeah. So that might actually be market driven instead of mandate driven in the US.
Bill Orts, USDA-ARSRight. And our understanding worked with Sinclair the technology exists to do it. It's price points and tolerance to price points. And then just meeting all the tight specs that we've come to expect from the excellence that we've had from old plastic products. I mean, this the existing technology works, you can print on it, you know, you can find adhesives. So, we kind of get used to a standard. If you notice, we talked about compostable like plates and clam shells. Sometimes the companies purposely make them look rougher, so that you know they're compostable. Maybe it is market driven. But if it's too slick, if it looks too much like polystyrene like styrene, a styrene. tray, then you'll put it in with the styrene trays. So you purposely make it a little coarser, a different looking so you know to put it in your compost bin.
Vonnie Estes, IFPAThat makes sense. Yeah. So switching a little bit to your lab and kind of how you're structured, as you're talking about with Sinclair and you've done a ton of partnerships and you've helped a lot of companies and often expanded on your mandate. So tell us how you work with industry and kind of how you know I'm curious In a lot of the work that you do, do you patent it? And then is there like a license? Or do you just do this for the good of the world and give your technology away? Or like how does that all work? How do you get engaged with industry?
Bill Orts, USDA-ARSRight? All of the above, so I'm giving it alright. I'll brag about the best example we've ever had and then act like it happens every day. Right. So the apple dippers at McDonald's. All right, which is a partnership we have with Monterey sizer. Dominic Wong in our group is an entomologist. And back about 20 years ago, he was working on oxidation reactions. And he just knew as a sidebar, that if he could stop those reactions, he could probably stop apples from turning brown, right any, like, okay, it's a pH trick. So he was it, it was basically a mixture of vitamin C and choc dusts, ascorbic acid and calcium key laters. So certain healthy minerals. And what he discovered was, you could add in the lab at the glassware level, you could just mix the two together, dip your apples in there, and they won't turn brown for 30 days or so. Sometimes. 40. Okay, really good news. We were about to patent that ourselves. And we went out and, and started to talk at, you know, food technology conferences. And, and so we got Monterey sizer, a food additive company, they sent their people to our pilot plant for most of the summer. And then, so they put in certain resources, they also put in people in time, and that was a really relationship where we worked in a trust with each other. And then we co wrote the patent with them. And they have exclusive use to it for the last 20 years and then European rights and pay us some licensing royalties back to us to the USDA. Our scientists don't necessarily benefit directly but the USDA does win situation, Montrose Pfizer is able to sell an additive that allows McDonald's and subway to sell 10s of millions of pounds of apples. They're in Happy Meals instead of French fries. Sometimes they made the school lunch program. USDA gets some royalties back. Right. Alright, so we have healthier kids. And Mom, try Caesar again, has benefited. So that's when it works well. Other ways as companies come to us with issues and problems and questions. You know, Clorox came to us and said, we’re interested in making the first compostable wipe, what do we do? We said, okay, well, we have machines that can test it, we have small extruders, we can put out films. And we can, you know, test the ASTM standards. You guys know the market. But we have some of the tools. And, and the other thing is we have the patience to do research for multiple quarters. So, what they did is paid me paid us to hire a postdoc and work on some of their pet issues for the next, you know, so many years. Oh, wow. Yeah. So, a lot of different ways. You come to see us mean, I like to say that if somebody I try to tell our team, if somebody from the ag community comes and asked you a question about something that's bothering them, the answer is we do that research, what is it? Like? How can we help you if it's important to you? It should be or could be important to us. So let us know more.
Vonnie Estes, IFPASo, Are most of your projects outside funded? And how do you sit down, you know, every year every two years and have a big strategic plan and figure out what projects you're going to work on? Or like how does, how do you decide which directions to go.
Bill Orts, USDA-ARSSo, we are mostly based funded, we're on a congressional mandate. And so, we sit down for a really big soul searching every five years. And then we write a big proposal, what we're going to do with the next five years, and then it goes through peer review, kind of, you know, national science foundation level really high ended, you know, send a lot of other PhD level scientists to make sure it makes sense, and they can grade it. And then, you know, we edit it and fix it. And that gives us a five-year cycle. So, the Zero Waste initiative, the byproducts initiative in this strategic crops about two years ago, went through this, you know, thought process and got approved, and that basically funds 80% of our work. And then we usually encourage folks to get about 20% Soft funding through grants and partnerships with companies. So, we do a yearly soul searching but then we have the five year cycle, which gives us five year mandate.
Vonnie Estes, IFPAI know through other conversations we've had you have touched an awful lot of the startup companies, especially the ones here in the Bay Area. And so how do you work with startups, and how has that kind of happened that you do some incubation work.
Bill Orts, USDA-ARSUm, so anybody can approach us and say they'd like to work with us. Some of the companies that approached us happened to be in the same mission area, that we have a five-year cycle, you know, we're mandated to be in this area. Now, rather than reinvent the wheel, we ask them if they want to partner. And we start to share resources. So, some of those companies recognize that since we're already based funded, sharing resources can turn out to be a pretty good idea. So, I can name names, one of the companies we're proud to work with is mango materials, which basically takes greenhouse gases and makes biodegradable plastics out of it exactly in our wheelhouse. So, we'll do what we can to help them, including, you know, so they pay a little in, but then we help them, we leverage our resources. So, they end up pretty well moving in and having folks in our building, using our equipment, leveraging this space that we already have to do this mission. And we both benefit. So, you multiply that out by any usually we have six eight companies as partners with our group at any given time. And sometimes it's small companies, and sometimes it's much bigger companies.
Vonnie Estes, IFPAThat's very cool. Yeah, it's such a, with a lot of startups, you see people just building the same capabilities over and over and over. And it just doesn't make sense. And so, if there's some way to kind of leverage knowledge and capabilities and stemware, yeah, it just makes sense to do that.
Bill Orts, USDA-ARSYeah, I mean, when mango was reading some of the early mangoes a standalone now, but early on, they could argue that they had access to multiple, you know, 60-liter fermenters, because they had access to our building, and we had multiple 60 liter fermenters. Each one of those fermenters could be nearly $100,000. To buy. So didn't necessarily have $600,000 in fermenters. But they had access to that number of fermenters. Right. And they got in, so it was a good leverage. Yeah. It was fun.
Vonnie Estes, IFPASo last question, kind of summary question for you. What are three ways that the produce industry can be more sustainable around the use of plastics and decreasing food waste?
Bill Orts, USDA-ARSWow, yeah, that's a. So, I'll go back to the, the PLU stickers work, right. So, make sure we maintain those. If we have if we can meet the mandate, save the French government, others and then you end up you know, individually wrapping fruits that we crazy. So, I like I like that model. Let's start there. It the closer we can get to the source of supply, in the supply chain, even in the packaging, the better we are, right. So, you know, the old adage, we used to be asked Do you want paper plastic? And people would automatically think that maybe paper is going to be more sustainable? And that was like to anyone who knows the system a little bit? That's a really nasty question, which is more sustainable? How? And the answer is like, how close are you to plastic supply? How far did your paper have to come? You know, did they use a lot of water making paper? Do they use a lot of water and making plastics? And so, part of the supply chain that we appreciate is getting closer to your sources cut down on carbon miles for anything. So, don't drive things as much as far and get more locally source sources of plastics and packaging material, right? Just get it closer. Get closer to the point sources. It's interesting companies like Walmart had mandates where they cut back on the number of boxes used. Kind of that was good news, right? Sometimes there's a mix though of a of a tray with a shrink wrap plastic over the top, say of you know, I don't know bottles of bleach. Those plastics though, instead of having to be you know, from the petroleum industry could be something from a sustainable source, and then you either you composted or recycling right there. Alright, so, I don't know if that answers your question fully. But it's, it's a complex issue. We have our work I've dedicated my whole career to try to reduce and reuse plastics, optimize their carbons. And then the final thing is end of life. Really think about what you're going to do with the plastic After you've used it, especially. So, if, if you can make packages that are compostable, educate the consumers what to do with the end at the end of life and tell them does it go in the blue bin? Or does it go in your, you know, your compost bin? And if it goes the compost bin, you know, what are the details where the tells on that, and where does it go? So, education and locally sourced is what we're pushing for.
Vonnie Estes, IFPARight? Yeah, I think it's, it's like you said in the beginning that the reason we use so much plastic is because it works so well. And so, when you have things like really wanting to cut down on food loss and food waste, that's really competing, you know, well, if you if you wrapped everything in plastic, then you'd have less food waste, but we don't want that. So, we have all these competing, you know, things that we're trying to do and I think looking for different ways to put you know, different things, containers and things to put food in because you know, we have to do that makes a lot of sense. And bio products are a great way to go. Well, thank you so much for your time and this insight, and I look forward to coming up and seeing your lab. I can't believe I've never been there, given how long I've been in the air. But I will work on that. And thanks again, Bill.
Bill Orts, USDA-ARSWelcome anytime. Thank you

You're listening to the fresh takes on tech podcast, a show from the International fresh produce Association. This is a show for people interested in the intersection between technology and the produce and floral industries. Every week we explore the problems, solutions, people and ideas that are shaping the industry. If you are interested in the innovations that create change, this is the place for you. Let's dive in.
Vonnie Estes, IFPAWell, welcome to fresh takes on tech. I'm your host, Vonnie Estes. And this is our first podcast of this season and the relaunch of the podcast. And we have a great guest that I can't wait to talk to today, Joel Makower, he's the founder of GreenBiz group. And Joel and I have known each other, I think, close to 27 years. So it's really great to have him on the show and to talk about his work in sustainability. Welcome, and good to have you, Joel.
Joel Makower, GreenBiz GroupThanks, Vonnie. That's been that long. It's amazing. I'm only 29. So I don't know how that worked out.
Vonnie Estes, IFPAOkay, so let's start with an introduction of yourself, your work and the GreenBiz group?
Joel Makower, GreenBiz GroupSure, well, I am a journalist and an entrepreneur. And I've spent my whole career 40 plus years starting companies, this is my third company in the mostly in the event information and media and events space. And for the past 37 years, I've been focusing at the intersection of business sustainability, and technology and innovation and corporate practice and strategy, how the world's largest companies and lots of small mid-sized ones as well are thinking about and integrating sustainability into their operations and aligning that with their core strategy, and all of that, and my company, GreenBiz group, I'm the co founder and chairman, we're about 50 people here in Oakland, California, we produce a daily news and daily, we have seven weekly free newsletters we put on for big in person events, I think thankfully back in person, as well as some virtual events throughout the year. And then we have a membership group of sustainability executives from large companies, billion dollar plus revenue companies, that we again, post COVID bring together multiple times a year for what we call peer to peer learning and what they tend to call group therapy. But this is a broad range of companies from food and ag to railroads, airlines, banks, tech companies, and so on. And so, so it's been really interesting to sit at that middle intersection and being able to listen to the conversations that companies are having.
Vonnie Estes, IFPASo you do focus a lot on the companies and what they're doing, they have tools and capabilities to solve a lot of the issues that we have around sustainability. Why do you think we don't have 100% of companies on board and practicing to the fullest extent?
Joel Makower, GreenBiz GroupWell, in a word change we all have, we like the idea of change, doing it is actually harder, I like to say that when it comes to change, we love the noun and hate the verb. And so this is, you know, companies have other priorities, particularly these days, your supply chain and talent acquisition and retention, and all the usual things around products and services and quality and delivery, and you know, finance and cash flow, all the things that companies deal with. And sustainability is still you know, on the list of the top five things that a CEO wants to think about on a given day, this falls to number seven or eight. And so it just doesn't rise to the top for enough companies. Having said that, there are many companies for which it does that are that see this as a as a huge risk factor, frankly, and are dealing with that and in ways that go well beyond what most the public generally sees. We can talk about this maybe but you know, most people out there assume that any company that's doing anything is ipso facto greenwashing, when in fact that actually the opposite is true that companies tend to be walking more than they're talking they actually doing more than they're actually saying and we can talk about why that's the case. But you know, this the idea of sustainability is compelling. You know, who wouldn't want to do the right thing for people on the planet while also aligning with profits and productivity? But it's not so simple and I know you know, this honor you've been in this field for a long time, but this is a these are very challenging things to do. Because there are simple things that companies do and you know, you can change out your light bulbs and tune your H fac and things like that. Sort of no brainers because they pencil out financially pretty quickly. But the harder things the higher hanging fruit if you will, is inordinately difficult to pick and so companies are struggling with that and because both change can be difficult Even when it's driven from the top, and the, as I said, the priorities don't always line up with what's going on. I mean, think about what's happening right now in the world, you know, particularly supply chains and caring about employees, customers and suppliers in Eastern Europe and you know, still dealing with the pandemic and everything else. Unfortunately, this gets shunted to the side.
Vonnie Estes, IFPAI have a couple questions from that one. You mentioned about the perception of greenwashing. And then a lot of times the public doesn't think that companies are really doing anything, and they just assume anything they say, isn't true. How did that public perception happen? And why is it happening? Because I certainly see that as well.
Joel Makower, GreenBiz GroupWell, I think early on, it was it was the activist community, the green pieces and others that that saw companies taking, you know, saying they were taking action and realizing that what they were doing either they either weren't doing what they were saying they were doing, or they were just making sort of generally gauzie kinds of commitments and statements, but nothing, not so much to back it up. Or they were dealing with some superficial things, you know, it's changing out light bulbs, but not the real problems that were there, their biggest impacts are more recently, it's, you know, became political. And I think that's factored in, in terms of company's willingness to do these things. But that's changing a lot now, because now a lot of this has been driven by Wall Street, at least for big publicly traded companies and large companies that are owned by private equity firms.
Vonnie Estes, IFPAThere's real metrics that you that people are measuring. So you have to show that what you're doing, right?
Joel Makower, GreenBiz GroupYeah, the metrics, and those are difficult, because they're not always consistent. Companies are being held accountable and being asked to provide more disclosure and transparency about their performance and their impacts. But still, even still, it gets harder to change in companies. You know, as I said, a minute ago, it's, this doesn't always rise to the top. And so companies know, they need to be able to talk the talk. And some of them, you know, genuinely want to do the right thing. But they haven't, they may not even know what the right thing is, they may think that, okay, we buy, we're buying green energy from our local utility, we've cut our waste significantly at our factory or headquarters, you know, we donate a nickel per widget sold to Ducks Unlimited, every third week in April, or whatever the you know, we're the good guys. And ignoring the fact that probably 80, or 90% of their impacts are in their supply chain, which you know, presents any number of challenges. And so, you know, there's still a lot of, despite decades of this, and so many of us, beating the drum and trying to educate the business community, there's still a lot of myths and misunderstanding about what you even need to be doing. And again, that's changing a lot, there's a whole new generation of employees coming in who are who do get it. So it's all really exciting, but it's just not changing at this scale, scope and speed we need. And we we saw recently, the latest IPCC report, and we, you know, get a little numb to those because they come out in there, I'll have these dire warnings and Code Red for the planet and all of this, but, you know, they become increasingly dire and, and still, we all sort of become numb to this. And it's sort of paralyzing for a lot of companies about what they really need to be doing, and how much of a difference they can make. One of the
Vonnie Estes, IFPAThings that I have seen in my career, and this is definitely improving as well, but certainly early on, people would hire a sustainability officer. And that person would be mid-level in the organization, you know, not report to the CEO would be kind of mid level. And they're like, Okay, check. You know, we hired our sustainability officer, now we're doing sustainability stuff, and it just didn't work very well, you know, and that person wasn't empowered and it didn't go through the whole organization. How are you seeing that, that change? Are those people getting more power and more influence? Is sustainability starting to really be a part of what everyone does? What's happening with that now?
Joel Makower, GreenBiz GroupYeah, you're right. I mean, for a long time, it was, you know, the sustainability person was seen as a, you know, off to the side that the tree hugger, the person who's gonna come up and, you know, come along and make things differently. It was like, oh, here comes Vonnie look busy, you know, and so that's changing a lot because there's still somebody in more and more people who have that sustainability title, sort of the quarterback, if you will, inside a company, but now it's being pushed out to facilities and operations and supply chain and finance and marketing and communications and government relations, Investor Relations and CFO and many other parts of the operation. And so it's less seen as a distraction or something off to the side again, because you know, employees get this employees realize you can't just sort of talk the talk and have a little window dressing here. You really need to be doing things and they want their employees employers to be doing these things and to be part of the solution and they're proud of Have them when they are. And again, that doesn't happen just by creating, you know, the, you know, as I said, the glossy reported to a nephew superficial kinds of things.
Vonnie Estes, IFPAI've heard you talk about the return on investment for climate and the risk of inaction. Can you define this and explain why it's important?
Joel Makower, GreenBiz GroupSure, I think you're referring to a piece I wrote earlier this year called the new ROI for climate, the risk of inaction. And you know, for a long time, how can we risk the economy or risk our business by investing in these kinds of changes that we're being asked to do to reduce our carbon or environmental footprint? And increasingly, we're seeing that it's actually we're flipping the script on that, that what's the risk of not doing these things? So we learned during the pandemic, that you know, this whole idea of flattening the curve, that the earlier you take action, the better your odds of mitigating the risks and minimizing the damage, but then we're starting to see, you know, these risks that can be found at pretty much every level company, community, national, global and catastrophic damage from extreme weather, the disruption of supply chains, the displacement of workforces, the increased burdens on the already reeling healthcare establishment a, you know, and you can measure these in monetary terms as well as just in lives and livelihoods. And so we're starting to see, you know, what is how does this filter down at the company level, what's the risk of inaction? How much more is it's going to cost later, to harden the targets, if you will, to make sure that we are less susceptible to extreme weather, for example, or the disruptions caused by extreme weather, because that's going to be increasing. So a lot of these things are is, as we learned, during the pandemic, that our supply chains are pretty fragile and brittle. And, and so you know, taking earlier action and making sure you're ready for what's coming, and it is coming. There's no no dispute about that is really what companies need to be doing. You know, we, every year in January, around the time of Davos, the World Economic Forum, big event, the World Economic Forum, and Marshall McLennan put out an annual Global Risks report where they, the 17th edition came out in January this year, they asked more than 1000 global experts to rank 37 global risks as their as to their potential to cause significant negative impact over the next decade. And the top ones were all climate related and biodiversity loss, extreme weather. And so these things are coming. And so what is the risk of waiting too long?
Vonnie Estes, IFPAYeah, I think this idea of flipping this, the script is really applicable to the produce industry and to agriculture, because we're not only trying to mitigate climate change, but we're also hugely at the effect of climate change. And so I'm already seeing places where it's too hot to grow the way that they were growing, or it's too cold, or the temperature swings are too up and down, or it's too wet, it's too dry, you know, so there really is a lot of changes that that we have to make, to be able to continue to grow the way that we grow, you know, people are looking at growing indoors as a way to mitigate that, you know, there's a big issue with water, we're not, you know, especially here in California, you know, we're not going to have the water that we need. So have you looked at that and thought about like with food? How do we work with this where we know climate change is coming?
Joel Makower, GreenBiz GroupYeah. I mean, you're right about flipping the script for a long time. Certainly, when it came to climate change, or even things like biodiversity, the question was just, you know, what's the impact of business on the climate? And that's still a question. But increasingly, the question is, what's the impact of changing climate on business, you know, to my earlier point around supply chains around being able to grow things? And so yeah, I mean, this whole push towards regenerative agriculture and, you know, how do you raise beef in a way that aligns with with being able to improve this soil health? And how can that then affect other crops, including, you know, fresh fruit and other produce and flowers and all of those things, you know, you're starting to understand that there that we have to sort of look at new ways of it's not just a matter of conducting business the same way, you know, with climate in mind, in some ways, business is going to have to change the way they do things. And agriculture, farmers, at least, traditionally have been stewards of the land. But you know, over the past 50 or 70 years, you know, really, the inputs have really started to take a toll and we're one of our biggest national security threats or global security threats really is soil health, and we're just not taking care of that. As I say, We're biting the land that feeds us. And there are agricultural techniques that are well known and established but sort of had been set aside for years around how do you farm in a way that improves enhances the soil and by the way, also sequestered carbon and may create some new revenue streams as there's a price on carbon. So those are still you know, back to my main word here change those things, those changes are hard, but they're starting to see movement, there were much more mainstream operations or end users, the McDonald's of the worlds or the Cargill is not the end users. But the main buyers of these crops and commodities are basically asking if not demanding these kinds of changes, because they understand that the continuity of their own business is dependent upon being able to ensure that that we have, you know, healthy soil and abundant crops, despite the new changes that are happening in the climate.
Vonnie Estes, IFPADriscoll is the global market leader of fresh strawberries, blueberries, raspberries and blackberries. With more than 100 years of farming heritage. Driscoll is a pioneer of berry flavor, innovation, and the trusted consumer brand of only the finest berries. Yeah, I mean, I may be a little close to it. So I'd love to hear your perspective of in the industry, we're kind of scrambling and figuring out what you know, everybody wants for gender tobacco, and everybody's talking about like, what does that mean? And how do we supply it? And how do we make money doing it? How do we not lose money doing it? And so I'd love to hear some of your thoughts from I mean, you have a broader worldview on how people are talking about regenerative ag and what the expectations are, can you give us a little window into that?
Joel Makower, GreenBiz GroupWell, first of all, I'm not sure we have clear definitions of what regenerative ag even means. And so it's, it is sort of this, you know, this vague term that sounds good and probably is good. But what does that mean? And how regenerative is regenerative? I know, that's a funny sentence. But those are the kinds of questions that it ultimately gets down to. And then there's also an assumption that you have to flip a switch and stop doing this and start doing that. And and that's, you know, may may be ideal, maybe actually, what's needed is, you know, make change at the level that we need to be making change. But it's not pragmatic from a real world view of companies and supply chains, and all of that. So I think what we're really encouraging progress, or is even just with companies that are starting to do some pilot projects, and not just how do you work with landowners and smallholders and others in terms of changing their operations? But how do you measure that? How do you measure soil carbon? And how do you measure carbon? You know, soil health, and then looking obviously, at the, at the, at the quantity and quality of the crops? Is those better or worse, the same? And so this is a slow, unfortunately, to slow, but transition. But again, I think the the idea that we need to make big changes quickly, can be paralyzing to a lot of companies. And so it's, you know, it's easier to just do what you always do, because first of all, you have to be in business. And second of all, it ain't broke, at least right now. And so making those kinds of changes, it doesn't have to be in a big way. But I think you know, my two word advice here, just start somewhere. Vonnie Ests, IFPA Yeah, no, I think that's definitely true. Because people I do see a lot of people get paralyzed, just saying, I can't do all that, you know, I can't do all that. And so, you know, a lot of times, it's just like, pick two things, you know, to do differently, and to think about soil health, and how you might do something differently. Because as you said, you know, the luck, a lot of the technology that's been developed over the last century, it has was good, we were able to feed more people and create more calories. And but now, you know, we've kind of done a lot of damage along the way. And so what do we need to do to kind of use technology and use information to wind that back and start regenerating the soil? It's, it's a huge issue. And I think as we're talking about greenwashing earlier, there's a lot of grower groups that feel like oh, now you're going to put something else on me that I have to lose money on. So that's a lot of the conversation is, you know, the risk ends up being taken by the grower, which is not where the risk should live, because he or she is not getting the advantage of changing these practices, you know, so there needs to be some sort of way where they don't have to take all the risk and spend all the money to do practices that really are best for the planet, to produce food for people. So it's a it's an interesting process. And I think, you know, it isn't a flip of the switch. And that's what a lot of people would like to see is just that the switches were all regenerative now, but I think it's a slow process and just increasingly using technology and not using technology, you know, to grow more sustainably and in a regenerative way.
Joel Makower, GreenBiz GroupAnd you brought up I think, an interesting point that where this stuff happens much more quickly is when it is a partnership when it is a collaboration between maybe multiple players, sometimes different parts of the value chain. Sometimes it's multiple companies that are that basically share the same suppliers or the same country suppliers, you know, how do we work with a specific country to help their farmers for this crop improve their the sustainability profile and so those these things don't just happen? because you ask your supplier to make a change, and then they say, Well, I don't know, you know, or sorry, no, you're just not in. And there's nothing you can do about it. Because you're not that big of a buyer. You know, it does require partnerships. Sometimes it requires third parties who bring folks together, whether those are public agencies, or sometimes environmental groups on the ground NGOs, or trade associations. And that's really how this stuff works. It just doesn't work by issuing new orders.
Vonnie Estes, IFPASo what role do you think policy and regulation plays? Can it play a positive role? Or is it always just make more trouble? Or how do you see that?
Joel Makower, GreenBiz GroupNo, AI policy is important. I mean, we need to set the floor, we need to provide incentives we need. And those are things that that that government can do? Well, sometimes we need subsidies, discounted loans, or loan guarantees, or any number of other things, which the agricultural community is very familiar with it, they just maybe for the wrong kinds of things, or at least the kinds of things that, frankly, may be causing some of these problems rather than addressing them. And so you know, government can absolutely play a role here. What's also fascinating is how much change has taken place in at least in the United States, in the absence of policy leadership, where, you know, we certainly over the past, you know, let's say five years, there hasn't been the kind of leadership or whether even if when there has been the right kind of leadership, there may be other forces on the lobbying front, and, you know, legislative fronts. Again, this could be at the national or the state and local levels that thwarts the kinds of changes that need to be made. But what's fascinating, as I said, is how much is happening. Because this is ultimately about business risk, regulatory risk, financial risk, reputational risk, technology risk, right to operate risk, if you're the largest water user in a water stressed area, you may not be able to do business, or if your supplier is, you know, they may not be able to operate. And so you know, these are increasing risks. And so companies need to be doing these things for risk mitigation purposes. And government can help and could accelerate a lot of these things and could stimulate even more change. But as I said, it's really impressive how much is taking place?
Vonnie Estes, IFPAWas involved in the ethanol and second generation ethanol industry for a while. And you look at that industry and how that was a lot of that was driven by legislation. And it was this really, you know, he talked about how it all ended up. But at the time, you know, a lot of money got put in, and a lot of people started paying attention to ethanol, and there was a lot of legislation, and it really got people going in. And we may be getting close to that around carbon, you know, where people are thinking, you know, from a risk mitigation, and from a legislation point of view is that it might help to put some things in place to to get people start developing more technologies and support technologies to be developed to really understand what's going on in the soil, measuring carbon and being able to do something to sequester it. So I think, you know, we may, I'm hoping, you know, we may be headed toward some sort of Nexus like that, where regulation can actually help.
Joel Makower, GreenBiz GroupWell, I hope it doesn't happen the way that ethanol happened, because that to me, was just was too prescriptive and incentivize things. And again, I believe that a lot of that was the result of lobbying by certain interests. I think it's better when government can set some broad goals or some broad, yeah, broad goals around carbon emissions reduction, or maybe soil health or water use, and let the free market figure out how to do that and create the incentives, both the carrots and the sticks for doing the right thing and, you know, penalize those who are the cheaters, and the laggards and who aren't doing it. But I think that the ethanol thing, you know, said, All right, we're all going to march down this direction. And here's billions of dollars to help, you know, pave the way and then turned out to not be the right direction. And I think if that had been a broader goal of how do we reduce petroleum use overall, which I think was what the ethanol thing was getting to and carbon emissions, then there are other ways to do that. And then all of a sudden, there, maybe it's a price on carbon. I'm not an advocate for any particular remedy there. Because there's lots of men, I'm not a policy geek. But I think that there are a lot of ways you can incentivize the market and provide the financial stimulus. And again, the regulatory penalties for not hitting in those directions. That's what we need to see and let let technology let competition and let all of that soar.
Vonnie Estes, IFPAWe've talked a little bit about supply chain and one of the things that I'm certainly seeing is when large companies like Walmart or McDonald's or cardio like you've mentioned before, when they have the market power to say look, this is What we want from our suppliers and this is what our expectations are. And that that changes everything. It sounds like they have an awful lot of power. But it also that's a ways without regulation. And that's a way to make big changes where they make demands, they need to meet their goals, and for them to meet their goals, they need to reach down their supply chain and have the supply chain help them meet those goals. Have you seen some case studies around that of how the larger companies have kind of forced change down the supply chain?
Joel Makower, GreenBiz GroupWell, you name two of them. And I think, you know, McDonald's and Walmart. It cuts both ways. I mean, I think, you know, a lot of suppliers to Walmart, and even those that are, you know, so deeply engaged with sustainability efforts don't really like the heavy hand that Walmart can have. And Walmart can force you know, the suppliers to absorb all of the costs of change and still deliver the product at the same price or less. And, look, Walmart is a hugely positive force in sustainability. And the commitments they've made project gigaton, and in particular, I think you're having a big impact, including in agriculture, you know, some of the sometimes the big companies have big, heavy hammers, and it's one way of doing it, and it may work. And sometimes it does, if you're the 900 pound gorilla, you kind of you can kind of call those shots. But there's lots and lots of other smaller, you know, you know, companies that even they're big, but they're nowhere near the size of a McDonald's or Walmart, who are also working with their suppliers and may not have the market clout to affect the kind of change but you know, there's strength in numbers here, where you start to see multiple brands, you know, really lean into this because they're driven by their customers, whether they're in grocery stores, or that are actual shoppers, demanding these kinds of things, or whether they're, you know, being revealed under the klieg lights of disclosure by activist groups or government agencies that that, you know, or investors that are ranking and rating these companies for there's unsustainability issues, you know, there's lots of different ways to affect change. But yeah, I mean, look, supply chains is, first of all, were overwhelmingly for, you know, most sectors where anywhere from 80 to 95%, of environmental, and particularly climate impacts lie. And so that is how change happens, you know, you ask your supplier who asked their supplier, and it can go down, you know, sometimes three or five or more different levels, with all the the middleman and aggregators and everything else it takes place that ultimately is how it has to happen. And again, as sort of as I was talking about on the government side, are these characteristics. And there are good examples of both.
Vonnie Estes, IFPASo wrapping up, I have one last question for you, if companies in food and produce are interested in being better in creating a more equitable future for themselves through sustainable practices, what are the three actionable steps in doing so?
Joel Makower, GreenBiz GroupWow, I'm going to give you a higher level answer maybe than the one you want. But I think the first thing is to what's your impact? Do you really understand your impacts and not just yours, but the impacts as they go down through your supply chain, and even in this is less relevant in the produce sector? But you know, what happens after you sell something? What are the impacts there? And that could go to food waste, and some other issues. But do you understand those things? Because I don't know that most companies do. And now that you do, that's one number two is well, what's the plan? Do you have a plan in place? Is it a bold plan, hopefully, that aligns maybe with science based targets that have been established by independent organizations? There's specific targets and timetables that you're going to be doing things? And is their disclosure, interim disclosure, saying, Okay, I have a 2040 or 2050, or even 2030 goal. But what am I doing next year or the year after that? How do I track my progress? And then number three is, how are you talking about this stuff, both internally and externally, upstream and downstream to your various communities? And is that aligned with what you're actually doing? Obviously, companies get in trouble when they get too far ahead of their skis on these things. That's where the word greenwashing often comes in. But it's also about aligning actual company policies and strategies and commitments with the, with their memberships in organizations and trade associations, perhaps, but also their lobbying activities, because there's a lot of cases of some of the most proactive companies, the leaders, if you will, in sustainability, that are either members of groups that are lobbying against all of everything that I think you and I want to see happen or are things that we know just need to happen or where and that's that used to be sort of in the back behind the scenes. Now it's becoming much more visible and it used to be safe for companies to keep, you know, keep quiet on some of these issues because they were controversial. And now you know, Being on the sidelines is becoming a less and less safe space. So companies are being asked to, you know, take a position on some of these things. Are you for price on carbon or against it? You know what it is don't just sit quietly and hope that it sorts itself out. So what do you know? What are you doing? And what are you saying are the three things that I go? I mean, I can, you know, we get deeper into some specific things that, you know, companies must be doing, but it really all stems from those three things.
Vonnie Estes, IFPAWell, I think that's the end of our time for our listeners out there who would love to get in touch with you? What is the best way for them to contact you?

Vonnie Estes, IFPAHello and welcome to fresh takes on tech. Today we are talking to a very exciting company, verdant robotics. Verdant has a platform that combines data analytics and crop applications like spraying and weeding into a single farming implement for specialty crop farmers. We're going to hear from all three co founders, Gabe Sibley, who's the CEO, Laurence Ibarria, who's the CTO and Curtis Garner, who's the COO. So happy to have all you guys together on this. So you each have unique backgrounds in robotics, please tell us about yourself. And how Verdant robotics was formed. And Gabe, why don't we start with you.
Gabe Sibley, Verdant RoboticsSo Vern robotics got started, really, when Curtis and I were introduced to each other for by some old colleagues of mine that had also been working with Curtis. And they recognized I guess, like souls, and they put us together literally in a bar, he sat there across the table, and after we realized, sort of the combination of technology and agriculture, that we should probably get together, and they should probably foot the bill. And they did do you know, to their credit, so they helped us get started. And Curtis did a really good job, helping me understand that the needs in agriculture and the challenges that we face, and I found it utterly compelling, you know, and from that the rest was history. The same time I was working with Laurence, Laurence got wind of it, and like, Hey, I think I want to come along to at that point, I was just absolutely excited because I knew we had real trifecta.
Vonnie Estes, IFPALaurence, how about you a little bit about yourself.
Laurence Ibarria, Verdant RoboticsI have been working for 10 years in the Silicon Valley, on Nvidia crews, working on GPUs in graphics, artificial intelligence, autonomous driving, it's an exciting place to be. But I always wanted to do something more I wanted to build a product that will solve a meaningful problem. I wanted to build a product that I will be proud of that will we go there will help people. I was working with the game. And then there was this opportunity, we can go over to AG tech to agriculture. And that time point in time, all the technology that have been brewing up in robotics, it was perfect to go into prominent European culture is a lot simpler themselves driving is that I mean, we can do meaningful changes. And it coincided with a coming crisis of labor, less and less people want to do this job, it becomes harder, and we need to produce more and more food. So there was no reason why not to jump in. And Curtis,
Curtis Garner, Verdant RoboticsFor me, it's been kind of a long road. I've always love computers and technology. In through my career, I kind of ended up in ag and started on a packaging tomato packaging facility, running the Ag operations over there and had a lot of fun, did a lot of automation projects. But then went to bowls farm in which was a 12,000-acre diversified row crop farm. And a couple of law changes were starting to happen, which was SB three and AB 1066. So minimum wage going to $15 an hour ag exemptions of overtime, going away, was going to roughly double the cost of labor on the farm. And as your listenership probably knows better than most farmers are price takers, not price makers. And so he's kind of looking at some of the labor costs on the farm and wondering how are we going to make up this difference. And it was through my passion for computers and starting to speak these ag tech events and had this chance meeting with the company that games talking about and getting into a room and really saw an opportunity to marry my passion for computers with the newfound love for ag and all of X challenges.
Vonnie Estes, IFPASo I was just thinking about Curtis, like when we first met and to remember who introduced us.
Curtis Garner, Verdant RoboticsI don't remember who introduced us, but I believe I remember our first conversation.
Vonnie Estes, IFPAYeah, so it was Tim Nuss of Modern Acre, I had to look it up because I'd forgotten. But I was asked to do a talk at CES on 5g. And I didn't know anything about 5g. So I got in touch with Tim and I said Who do you know that can help me and He gave me your name. And that was like it was in 2019. Pre COVID Obviously, and Curtis was so amazingly with his time and kind of explaining what 5g was and what it could do and how I should talk about it at CES. And that's how I got to know Verdant robotics. And then I was so excited about the company. And I kept wanting to talk about it. You know, every place I went when people were saying, what's new technology. And so I kept saying to Curtis, you know, can I talk about it? Can I talk about it? And they kept say no, no, we're stealth and you know, I was just calling like every six months. Okay, I want to talk about this. So, so finally, I was really happy when you guys came out of stealth and start talking about the great stuff that you were doing and that's been a fun road Watching you guys grow. One of the things that I'm working on right now that I want to talk to you about is I'm doing this accelerator where we're trying to bring new technology into the produce industry. And so this technology, a lot of it is, you know, not mature technology, but developed technology in different kinds of industries and in different parts of the world. And so I'm putting an accelerator together, where we're going to have 10 to 12 companies that will go through a program and really learn about the produce industry and what the opportunities are. And so the applications are due April 4. So depending on when you're listening to this, you know, may have already passed, but we'll do it every year. Anyway, I wanted to hear from Laurence and Gabe, and just your thoughts on bringing new technology since you come from outside the industry and just how you thought about jumping into ag and what we might do to bring more technology to agriculture.
Curtis Garner, Verdant RoboticsA two-point game. That's a wonderful story that he tells that it is really the one of the founding stories of Verdant in all prompt gaming, and he'll definitely tell it but it's about Verdant robotics being verdant being green robots and the label or the caliber of talent we've been able to attract to Verdant in wine. Yeah,
Gabe Sibley, Verdant RoboticsI guess one way to talk about why we've been able to attract such talent advertent. And, and why it firstly, it's compelling. For me, it's a holistic endeavor, right? A lot of the folks that work here are outdoors men and women, you've got hunters and fishermen, and rock climbers and bikers and skiers and surfers, so people that genuinely love the outdoors. But a lot of the folks are used to working in a basement where the only light comes from the glow of a screen. And there's these deeply cerebral, you know, intellectual folks that have this whole other aspect of their being that has been separate from their professional lives. And at Verdant, we get to do a bit of both, you know, we get to work outdoors, we get to work with our hands. But we also do something that's intellectually really challenging. And at the same time, you know, when you're using 95%, less chemicals, and helping farmers farm way more profitably, you're helping people but you're also really helping the environment growing healthier food. And so for folks that appreciate the outdoors, and that hands on, you know, way of being that can marry that with their intellectual passion as well, it becomes this much bigger, more holistic endeavor. And that has attracted absolute top talent. And that's, you know, how we get guys that, you know, wrote the code for the Mars Rovers and the self driving cars and design all the lasers and the computer vision systems are Boston Dynamics, like really talented people, because it's a much more motivating, holistic endeavor.
Vonnie Estes, IFPASo do you think you know, as we're thinking about bringing in new technology, part of that is then finding this really great talent and attracting them and then they bring the technology with them is that sounds like that's a way you think it's a good thing way to bring technology in.
Curtis Garner, Verdant RoboticsThe way that I think about it is, it's a, an awareness problem on the side of the technologist, they don't know the needs that the produce industry has that that farming has. And so it's making them aware of it, everybody that we've hired, and a lot of the folks that I've talked to, and we've interviewed, they don't want to make the next Facebook, they don't want to make the next Instagram app or Tinder app, those aren't intellectually stimulating to them. Those aren't endeavors that are going to progress humanity. And it's really something meaningful in the work in helping humanity to move forward as a species.
Laurence Ibarria, Verdant RoboticsI have a greater story when we started Verdant, Curtis took us on a tour of several months to see many different crops, how are they growing on what the challenges they had before then? I didn't know what problems were that when I see those problems as an engineer, I want to go and build a solution immediately. Sometimes what we need is more awareness of what are we doing today? And people will just jump into fixing it.
Gabe Sibley, Verdant RoboticsYeah, I think that's a really good point. It's the urgency and the need, and the fact that there's a real challenge and then gluing that together with just how important it is. And also, quite frankly, the technology's ready, right? There's capability now that we should deploy. I mean, I've been doing this for decades, and forever, it was like space and military, right. And, you know, about 10 years ago, the self-driving car world started to heat up and we're still waiting for that. So trying to find really valuable applications for this technology has not been obvious or easy. And everybody kind of imagines that we're going to have robots that do stuff for us and someday that will be true, but it's not a super obvious straight path. But in ag, it's like, we can do this, we can bring value, and we can do it now. And so it's super exciting time.
Vonnie Estes, IFPAYeah. And there's such an obvious need. And you know, but we're demanding more of robots to work in, you know, uneven ground and mud and rain and heat and cold. And so it's challenging for people like you one more question on this, and then I'll get off it. But obviously, you're entrepreneurs, but I look at you know, is it is? The bet is, is there a path for entrepreneurs to bring and develop technology like, like you all have done, which is very successful? And we need that? Is there also a path for some of the companies that own this more mature technology? Would they be interested in getting an ag and some of these companies that just are deploying these technologies in space and some other things? And is that a place we should look for technology? Or is that just too complicated?
Gabe Sibley, Verdant RoboticsIf the answer is complicated, you know, why is it that successful, large incumbents have difficulty innovating into new spaces it you know, not to pick on Google. But you know, they have some of the smartest people in the world and some of the most advanced technology in the world, but they're not viewed as, you know, a fountain of novel successful companies. A lot of brilliant companies seem to languish. And really, people seem to languish. That's actually one of the reasons why we're able to hire because people ship something, and they don't want it to just sit there in the lab forever, and then get canned eventually, they want their lives to be dedicated to something meaningful. And there's something about the sort of raw existential nature of a startup where you know, all of the marbles are being played for. And I think it brings out the best in people. And that's kind of why startups can disrupt bigger companies. So I think we can view those bigger companies as training grounds for the people we're gonna hire.
Vonnie Estes, IFPAYeah, great answer. Thanks. Alright, let's move on to Verdant that you recently announced your robot as a service model. How is this unique? And how is this gonna specifically benefit growers?
Gabe Sibley, Verdant RoboticsYeah, the robot as a service model does a couple of things, you know, first, and allows us to give farmers ROI from day one, you know, we're gonna have to talk about in years to pay back, it happens immediately. The technology itself unlocks so much additional value that, you know, some of the farmers we're working with are seeing like 50% reduction in costs. And we still have healthy margins, because fundamentally, the technology is unlocking a lot of value. There's also the fact that the technology is changing very rapidly. And if you adopt a model of like, you know, here's the keys and you walk away and drop off some hardware is going to be obsolete near. And, you know, that's a real burden for the owner is trying to operate that hardware, the value for what we're doing, we're at the stage where it's tip of the iceberg discovery of the value. And we have found that it's in conversations with growers and agronomists that we really find the transformative new value that simply didn't exist before. And that you won't get to those conversations if you don't have boots on the ground if you're not deeply engaged with skin in the game, partnering with growers. And so, we don't believe that the just drop off the keys and walk away model is going to uncover the real value, especially as the technology is changing so quickly. And so that led us to this Ross model where we partner with people.
Curtis Garner, Verdant RoboticsAgain, maybe you can tell the story about Jeff Cohn beanie and Lodi farming in how we came to.
Gabe Sibley, Verdant RoboticsYeah, this is a great story. So trying to figure out really how we could be helpful, you know, curse took us on the six month listening tour. So we made sure that we're not, you know, a solution in search of a problem, but we're really understanding the problems to get started because in the beginning, you know, honestly, the technologists don't at the same time, we want to pique the imagination of growers and agronomists so they can imagine what the technology could do. And so we're walking the farm out there. And Lodi, I was trying to figure this out. I said, Hey, Jeff, imagine if you had your best agronomist, standing here watching this apple cluster 24 hours a day throughout the whole season. And if anything happened, you didn't like you could reach out and adjust it. You know, if a fly lands on the wrong side of the leaf, you could reach out and brush it away. You could deliver exactly the right input at exactly the right time. What could you do? And Jeff was like, Wow, if I could do that I could grow at eight every time. I didn't know it at eight we're at Apple's prevent is better than 100 Apples prevent. So it's a bigger apple. And so I said well, you know, what's that worth? And it turns out is worth a lot. And you just can't do that when your broadcast spraying to do crop lead management. You can't control outcomes when you only do actions you know at one time per season, or a small number of times, but with computers And with robots, we can do it specifically per apple, you know, we can trap and track an apple from, but all the way through to harvest and give you a time lapse video of any apple in the orchard you choose. And so, you know, computers have that capability, people can't do that. And that then unlocks new value.
Vonnie Estes, IFPASo what I've seen great videos of this working in the field and the information that it gives, what value does I give being able to track an Apple Blossom all the way through? How does that give value to apple production?
Gabe Sibley, Verdant RoboticsWell, so specifically for crop load management, you want to remove sort of four fifths of the apples on the tree, if you don't do that, you know, you end up with golf ball sized apples that aren't worth anything. And you want to remove them early, so that the carbohydrate energy in the tree is, you know, guided into growing fewer but much larger, or profitable apples, that's why you do Problem Management by doing it. When each blossom is ideally situated to be thinned, instead of doing it only a few set times, you're optimizing the outcome. So that allows us to shift the pack out and grow bigger apples. So the system is detecting and tracking and recognizing in real time, like, oh, I need to deliver pollen to that blossom. Now oh, I need to shoot fertilizer on that other blossom now to stop it from becoming an apple, thereby, you know, achieving crop load management. So that that type of value for a farmer is it's like two to 3x increase in net profit, depending on the variety that you're talking about Napoles
Curtis Garner, Verdant RoboticsVonnie, I'm so excited about the program that you're going to put together because part of our challenge at Verdant is we have great relationships kind of on one side of the supply chain, and that's to the grower, but you represent your listener ship represent a whole other side of the supply chain, in one of the ideas for the future that we have, which already exists out there in some other companies. But you know, provenance tracking and knowing exactly where each apple or each head of lettuce comes from, we could system systematize that and having unique barcode for every single piece of produce.
Vonnie Estes, IFPAEverybody's looking at that whole traceability for all sorts of reasons right now and trying to figure out how do you how do you pull that through, you know, all the way to consumers knowing and retailers knowing and that can have such value and in decreasing food waste throughout the chain and just more information. So this, the podcast series that this podcast is in right now is about sustainability. I've talked to a number of people about sustainability and some of the issues and we're seeing organizations adopt very different sustainability practices in their organizations. Your robots are collecting data along with doing spraying and weeding and how are your customers you in using the data now that you collect to enable greater levels of environmental stewardship and sustainability on the farm?
Gabe Sibley, Verdant RoboticsYeah, so we've got great partners, like the folks we work with over it Bolthouse that are incredibly progressive. So they're really looking to, you know, they are forward leaning, when it comes to, you know, looking for making ESG real, how is it that they can get the metrics and track all the way through the system? So that those decisions are actually driven by real data on the ground? The problem with ESG? Forever has been that how do you actually know the metrics are real? How do you know the data represents what's actually happening, because we can give them those metrics, we can arm them with the data of here's what took place where here is actually an example of using 95% less chemical inputs, they then can glue that through and have really data driven discussions around how it is more sustainable, how it is actually hitting those ESG metrics, and make it a data driven quantitative discussion, instead of a more of a soft discussion.
Vonnie Estes, IFPAAnd I think collaborations like that, like you're one with Bolthouse. And they're really taking the lead around regenerative and some of these sustainability conversations. And it's so valuable to have you working, you know, with the technology that you have, and enabling all of those decisions and discussions and Bolthouse working all the way down, you know, to retail with some of their products. And so those, as Curtis was just talking about when we really start looking at how do we get better and better information going through the chain. That's a great example of having these collaborations because you have to know what they want and what they can use. And they have to know what you can do.
Curtis Garner, Verdant RoboticsWhat are the unique values that Vernon can bring to the table and Lars can speak to it a little bit better than I can't because he's actually developing it in real time is we do three things. So we index act and then the Discover part. And so this discover part with ESG has to do with ABX testing and the ability to try different chemicals at different rates at different times across time zones and continents because we could replicate because it's machine to machine and give it a carrot field or an apple orchard, we can randomize the trial not just within a block, not just in a row trees or row carrots, but inside a tree individually and systematically track that through the computer. And so it'd be large can speak to a little bit better.
Laurence Ibarria, Verdant RoboticsThe data we collect is actually very comprehensive. This decision of the farm, we know how the farm has been growing. We know the weather patterns, we know the speed at which the plants grow. We know also, what kind of chemicals have we delivered, and then scrub this was saying we can be drying, what would work best on the situation. And try is a way to have a systematic approach to how can we grow bigger, better crops, we're trying to apply this on an apples karats. And in other crops that we go, it's a long period of time. All of these wasn't possible before. Because you could do a test in very few fields with very few chemicals, but you will not be able to really control your variables. To really understand how things apply. You either need to have a very tight control, which means that your results don't apply to many places, or you are constantly testing everything everywhere.
Curtis Garner, Verdant RoboticsIn what are the ideas that came to me by two different companies in two different commodities, they gave us the idea of actually applying organic methods on their conventional acres just because the customers like save marks, and Nestle's and McCormick’s of the world are driving that through to them. And so they would absolutely love to, to use organic methods in their conventional acres, which to me was just kind of a mind blowing idea that I didn't even think about that I didn't even relate. But it's been driven by the consumer through the value chain. And now we have a tool that can do that and track that over time, which is quite amazing.
Vonnie Estes, IFPAYeah, I was actually on a organics panel yesterday. And and one of the questions that I was with two other people who were very deep in the organics industry. But one of the questions that I was asked was about new technology use in organics. And so many of the technologies don't fit into the standards, the organic standards governed by the USDA. And but I think what some of the stuff that you're doing does fit and actually use you as an example of technology that that they can use. So talk a little bit about the weed killing capacity, and just some of the things that you can do that would fit into an organic operation.
Curtis Garner, Verdant RoboticsYeah, that's exactly where the conversation came from. So it was very large garlic company would like to not use Cloud phosphate within their conventional acres. And the same went for a very large Winegrape producer. And so they both have the same idea that's both driven by their customers. But it was around the glass phosphate issue from the consumers. And then being able to apply organic herbicides, which are contact materials that don't have herbicide carryover, or any residue issues, there's no real risk to human health with the materials that we use. So it's, it's much better for the environment and much better for humans. And so they really wanted to do that, which was just kind of a very exciting conversation for me to have, because I didn't think of it myself, it came from the customers.
Vonnie Estes, IFPAYou can catch it earlier, right? Because you can actually get the weeds before the eye can see it because the computer can see it. And you have to use so much smaller amount of whatever material you are using. So it is it's a great opportunity. Yeah,
Curtis Garner, Verdant RoboticsAbsolutely. Our technique is to go early and go often. And we can use less efficacious materials and go more often, at some point in time, we'll turn on the autonomy. There's a lot of folks here that have done self-driving cars and self-driving vehicles on other planetary bodies. And so it's a technology that we have in our back pocket. And once that technology is unleashed, labor is almost free, you can start to think of it. And that's how we've really been able to pique the imagination of the customer. And it's like, if you imagine Labor's free, what would you do if you could pay for an agronomist to sit there and babysit Every Apple, every carrot? What would you do? And it's through those conversations and piquing their interest that we come up with these transformative aspects.
Vonnie Estes, IFPAYeah, I bet because that's like no one. No one would even think about that. Because, like, how would you even start thinking about that? Because it's not possible. But I imagine you start having these conversations of you know, if this were possible, how would you farm and that really changes how people look at things.
Curtis Garner, Verdant RoboticsIt's a real conversation. It takes time it took us several meetings with Jeff to for him to understand exactly what we were trying to say in the messenger trying to convey. So it takes a minute to lambda that it took us a minute to really understand what he was trying to say to us and what the real value that he saw that we could bring to the table. So it's a conversation that evolves over time. And the only way it happens is if we get our boots dirty, and we rub shoulders together often.
Vonnie Estes, IFPASo switching gears a bit, we're all worried about the geopolitical humanitarian an economic crisis caused by Russia's invasion of Ukraine, which can quickly turn into a global food security crisis. So how does startups like Verdant play a role today, or perhaps in the future and these types of issues?
Curtis Garner, Verdant RoboticsVonnie you're absolutely nailing it, it's a really hot button issue for us. So Russia and China are the world's manufacturers of fertilizer, our customers have seen a 300% increase in their price of fertilizers, you know, 25% of the wheat for Africa comes out of the Ukraine. So we just see this energy crisis, a humanitarian crisis in this food security, that's a national security issue for all nations, and we're so happy to be in a place to deliver the technology that is a solution to that need to that problem, we can grow the same amount of food if not more, with 60 to 90% 95% less inputs. And so we could take the amount of fertilizer we have and we could stretch it much farther, and we could still grow the world's calories.
Vonnie Estes, IFPASo final question to each of you what makes you most excited about the work you're doing at Verdant now? Laurence, why don't we start with you,
Laurence Ibarria, Verdant RoboticsFor me excited is building. It starts by helping farmers and growers solve the problems that we have today. And we will issue but as I look forward, Verdant’s mission is robotics at large, we are looking, we know what ideal world we would have many other companies join. That's actually what really emotionally
Curtis Garner, Verdant RoboticsYeah, for me, Vonnie took me 30 some odd years to kind of dig in internally and figure out what my values and my system was. But I really learned that I drive a lot of value in life from significance and impact. And I'm just so grateful to be here with these three gentlemen is opening Pandora's box to have technology to the agriculture, the Pandora's Box, probably a bad analogy. But a computer vision is going to fundamentally transform agriculture. And we're just at the beginning of that, and for us to be at the forefront in delivering this technology. I'm so excited, so thankful to be here, we've changed the world. Nobody knows about it. Thanks to you, more people will know when this podcast comes out some I'm so grateful for that. And I'm just really excited. It's really the tip of the iceberg is scape Center.
Gabe Sibley, Verdant RoboticsFor me, working with farmers has been eye opening, growing food that's healthy and good for people is just a fundamentally good thing to do. So it's fantastic to be involved in an industry that's in my experience so far just chock full of good people doing hard work that's really meaningful. The fact that's married with the bigger robotics technology mission, you know, what does it mean to automate work in a successful way, you know, the day that humanity works wakes up and our chores are done. That's a success for humanity. And we're at the very beginning of that sort of automation transformation. And I think some of the most meaningful work that's going to happen in that is really in ag. So it's a great comment, the fact that it is sort of this holistic endeavor is really fantastic. It's totally motivating. It's good work to do. It's fun work to do is challenging. So it's totally engrossing.
Vonnie Estes, IFPAI think Verdant is such a great example of bringing really smart people smart minds with new technologies into the industry and starting to transform the industry. And so I really hope that other people hear this podcast and are inspired by what you all do and think about what big problems that they could solve. And nothing's more important than food. You know, we all need it every day. And so I'm so excited that you guys are finally out of stealth mode and really making an impact. So before we wrap up, where can people get in touch with you and learn more about Verdant?
Gabe Sibley, Verdant RoboticsI think the easiest thing if you want to learn more about Verdant robotics is just to head over to Verdant robotics comm there you can find information about how to get in touch with us. And you know, if you're a farmer, if you're a grower, please reach out. We're busy scaling onto new farms every day. And it's great time to get in touch.
Curtis Garner, Verdant RoboticsGreat. And I'd say if you're a retailer or distributor or on the other side of that supply chain, we'd love to talk to you as well. We'd love to learn more about the industry as a whole.
Vonnie Estes, IFPAFabulous. All right, thank you very much. It's great talking to you. Thanks so much, honey. Thank you. Bye.
Thank you

Hello and welcome to fresh takes on tech. Today we are tackling food waste. Our first guest is Dana Gunners executive director of ReFED. Later in the program, we will talk to Aiden Mouat, the co-founder of Hazel Technologieses, a technology that is used in the industry to cut down on food waste. But back to Dana, welcome to the show.
Dana Gunners, ReFED
Thank you, it's great to be here. Reset is a national nonprofit working to in food loss and waste across the US food system. It's my go to source for food loss and waste information, I've always going to the website and looking things up when I need to understand more about the issues. So please start by telling us the scope of the problem and food waste and produce.
Dana Gunners, ReFED
Sure, happy to well, you know, broadly about 35% of all of our food in this country is never eaten, and that totals to over $400 billion. But when you look specifically at produce is actually the largest part of that it's 34% of all the food that is surplus in this country is produced that has a value of almost $50 billion, the greenhouse gases that it takes to grow and cool and cook and transport that add up to over 20 million tons of co2 and it takes almost a billion gallons of water as well to grow that food. So, a huge just like huge numbers around this. And then if you look at it by the sector, by far the biggest sector, when you look at produce is the farm level, we estimate there's about 16 million tons of produce, that are surplus at the farm level with about 9 million of those being edible. And maybe we can talk a little bit more about that distinction in a bit. And you know, beyond that, the second most we estimate is actually in homes, a lot of produce going to waste in homes. It's the number one product that goes to waste in households across America.
Vonnie Estes, IFPA
So why is this happening? What are some of the causes of food being left behind in the field and also in other parts of the supply chain?
Dana Gunners, ReFED
Sure, well, first of all, say that, you know, people talk about this, like it's one problem, but it actually looks very different when you're looking at you know, farm level versus a restaurant or something like that. So, you know, when you look at the farm, some of the key drivers are one, just the variability of pricing with produce, you know, a lot of guessing games around what produce is going to sell for. And then you know, last minute decisions about whether or not it's worth harvesting, and things like that, certainly specifications are constantly hearing about, you know, the bent cucumbers or the slightly sunburned cauliflower, or the large broccoli heads that don't get harvested. Actually, I just spoke with one woman who drove past, you know, a 60-acre field of broccoli that went on harvested because the heads were too big, for instance. And so just the specifications limit that what gets harvested. And then you know, we hear about spot market versus longer term contracts playing a role, you know, growers really trying to make sure that they're able to make contracts by planting a buffer in terms of quantities, so that can add to it as well. And I think, you know, with produce, in particular, there's the food loss that's happening at the farm level, it's not necessarily the farmers that are doing that, right. There's a lot of like market dynamics that essentially manifest at the farm level. And I think that's why we see so much happening there.
Vonnie Estes, IFPA
So, what are some of the solutions out there that you're seeing, especially at the farm level, what types of things are people doing so that not as much food waste is happening, probably
Dana Gunners, ReFED
the most notable thing we've seen are some of these companies that are popping up and trying to buy up some of the surplus or they like to call it imperfect produce that is out there. You know, we've seen companies like imperfect foods, get to last I saw like a $700 million valuation just for buying up, you know, and now they've expanded beyond just produce, but really being able to absorb some of that slightly, you know, awkwardly sized or shaped or colored product as well, just the surplus that happens or some of those rejections that take place. But in addition to that, you know, we're seeing larger chains start to play around with the idea of offering, you know, expanding their specifications or offering you know, some of these, quote ugly lines separately, I think we're still waiting to see what I think is one of the fundamental solutions, which is just reevaluating what the main specifications are for produce, you know, by the large buyers and seeing if we can actually expand those to include, you know, a little bit wider variety of color shapes, size, ripeness, etc.
Vonnie Estes, IFPA
So is some of that it seems to be happening a little bit of consumer education, like maybe your produce doesn't have to look perfect. And you're you'll still buy it so that it doesn't get left in the field.
Dana Gunners, ReFED
Yeah, exactly. And I think that's where some of these companies like the imperfect foods of the world are having an outsized impact, because beyond the, you know, what they're able to buy directly, they are starting to shift the consumer, you know, tolerance, I would say, for different looking product. Similarly, farmers markets, you know, you are more and more as farmers markets are out there, I think they are also changing people's just expectations around what produce is supposed to look like. So hopefully, all of that can add up to also provide grocers and others the ability to, you know, just test out what it would mean to expand their specs.
Vonnie Estes, IFPA
So, what are the tradeoffs that you're seeing with various solutions in produce? I mean, there's some good things and some bad things and some of the solutions.
Dana Gunners, ReFED
Yeah, you know, I think there are in anything, there are tradeoffs, certainly here there are as well, with produce, I think probably the biggest is packaging. You know, there are certain types of produce the English cucumbers are the great example that we hear a lot where, when you wrap them in plastic, they last a lot longer. But of course, that adds packaging waste. And so, there is this trade off that I think really comes down to product by product and how a particular product behaves as to whether or not it's worth it, but just how much packaging is the right amount, in order to do its fundamental job, which is protect a product and hopefully extended life. And we're starting to see some exciting things happening there. Like, you know, different forms of active and intelligent packaging that can communicate temperature exposure, you know, an ad, advances in compostable packaging, two types that are truly biodegradable and actually work within the commercial composting systems, I think that's been a little bit of a challenge as well. So certainly, packaging is one big trade off, you know, another isn't in fresh. And of course, there's a huge movement to increase, just consumption of fruits and vegetables now, and often that's, I think, interpreted as fresh. But of course, as people go out to buy more fresh produce, they also can wind up wasting more fresh produce as well, I think there's a little you know, there's potential for a nutrition type of trade off. I think, however, though, solutions, like frozen, have a lot to offer when it comes to increasing consumption, making it really easy for people to consume fruits and vegetables, but also not having them go to waste if they don't use them up in, you know, three, four days.
Vonnie Estes, IFPA
Now, so circling back to the scope of the problem, how are we getting data to even know what the problem is? I mean, I think about as I drive by farms and see some things that weren't harvested, nobody's really counting. So how do you get such amazing amount of data? How do you get that data? And how could that data be gathered better to give us better information?
Dana Gunners, ReFED
Yes, my favorite question that I could geek out on forever, but don't worry, I won't. Yeah, well, one of my favorite things is that you want to whatever. No one thinks they have waste, right? If you the average American, one of my favorite statistics is that the average American sorry, 75% of Americans say they waste less than the average American, which is Wow, artistically impossible. Right. And I think it kind of makes me chuckle. But also, you know, you talk to chefs, they have no waste, you talk to grocery stores, they don't have a lot of ways. And when you talk to farmers, they also, you know, will tell you they have very little waste. And so of course there's it's a loaded word waste, right. And we like to talk about surplus food and things like that. But oftentimes, I think people have become numb to it, and they don't see it. And so that's the first challenge in measuring it is that, you know, if you ask someone how much broccoli they left on a field, and they don't count the large heads on the small heads or the, you know, Loreta that come after the main harvest, well, then, of course, they have none. But if you when you start taking that second look, you can see it and so it can be a challenge. I think step one is trying to really get people to see what we're asking them to Measure. But once we've done that, it's challenging. Certainly, at the farm level, there's been very little actual measurement and collection. So, our estimates are based on just a handful of academic studies that have spent time in the field, drawing, you know, little squares in the field, counting everything that's edible, weighing it and kind of extrapolating across the whole field size. And so, we're really using that combined with estimates of acres planted and acres harvested to try to get a sense of what's happening at the farm level. But there's need and I think a lot of utility and trying to do better when it comes to farm scale, produce loss measurement, there's an effort called the stewardship index for specialty crops that has created a whole rubric around this and is building it into different software systems to try to help growers measure better. And I one thing I think that's so important about that is that it really facilitates a conversation downstream with customers about what's going to waste why, and you have a lot of these bigger buyers committing to huge reductions in food loss and waste, and I think, potentially open to a conversation around altering relationships in a way that could lead to less waste. But without the data on how much is going to waste, it's pretty difficult. So, I think it's a first step in that as well.
Vonnie Estes, IFPA
Is there any way to do like ministers, probably privacy issues, right, but satellite, you know, tracking? Like, just what, using satellites to just watch fields and watch how much is left? I mean, is anyone trying to do that?
Dana Gunners, ReFED
It's a great question. It's one I've thought about, but I haven't heard anyone actually doing it yet. I do think there's some opportunity there. I also think there's opportunity to use that technology as a solution. Because you know, one of the challenges is that there's a lot of guesswork in how much is planted of different crops. And so, you know, I'll hear the story that Oh, broccoli sold at $30 a case. And so, then the next year, everyone planted broccoli, and then it was selling for $6 a case, right. And so, if only there were transparency into how much was being planted in total for different crops, I think that would be really useful information for growers to adjust around. And I think there's potential for satellite imagery to play a role in that, but I haven't seen anyone do it yet.
Vonnie Estes, IFPA
Yeah, I think as you were mentioning, before, just thinking about contracting downstream, and having some of these smart contracts, where people know that they're going to sell what they grow, and they don't need to overgrow or under grow, and then also retailers know, you know, what they're going to get. And I think that whole transparency in the system is going to make a big difference of just making sure stuff isn't unused, because there isn't a market for it.
Dana Gunners, ReFED
Yeah, you know, in the UK, Tesco has sort of been experimenting with this concept of whole crop purchasing, where instead of buying, you know, fancy, great fancy apples, you know, a certain quantity of it, they actually will purchase like a percent of the farm. And then they will take ownership of all the grades of a product, and they will then find ways to use it. So, they'll send it to juicing, or they'll send it to processing or they'll sell it fresh. And it really spreads the risk around in a different way. So, I'm fascinated by that concept and trying to use it here, you know, if possible.
Vonnie Estes, IFPA
Yeah, that's a great idea. I was also talking to a woman in Australia recently. And it's working with technology throughout the chain. And in Australia, it's much more vertically integrated, where you've got, you know, the retailers will own the farms or own the product that comes off the farm, similar type of thing. And so, then you've just got, you may you're making different economic decisions when you're sharing the risk. So that does make sense, and maybe a way to move some of our system. So just to wrap up, I have one last question for you. So, what are three things that the produce industry could do to reduce food loss and waste?
Dana Gunners, ReFED
You know, I, my first wish for the previous industry is to sort of have a really candid cross supply chain conversation about kind of what we're talking about right now, like the risk, how to share risk, and how to how contracts and other buying arrangements can be altered in a way that lead to less waste because I have a hard time seeing fundamental changes take place without that. So, I think there's absolutely room for a really candid conversation and you need the big buyers in the room, and You need the girls in the room. And there needs to be a level of honesty that I think can be challenging sometimes in this setting. So that'd be one. I think. Secondly, as I mentioned, I, you know, I'm thrilled to see the imperfect and these alternative markets growing, I think there will always be extra and so continuing to support these alternative sales channels and alternative marketplaces is a key option and trying to build more of a critical mass so that almost like the Craigslist of produce where people can really put what they have on and someone else can buy it, I think that would be really useful. And lastly, taking another key look at specifications, as I mentioned, and having really experimenting in stores with expanded specs to see if that could make a difference. Are you know, products still sells?
Vonnie Estes, IFPA
Great. Well, thank you. It's always enlightening to talk to you. And please keep up all your good work. And I will catch you another time.
Dana Gunners, ReFED
That sounds great. Thank you so much for having me, Vonnie.
Vonnie Estes, IFPA
So now we have Aiden Mouat, the CEO and co-founder of Hazel Technologieses to join us and talk to us more about food waste. Welcome, Amy. Thanks for being here.
Aiden Mouat, Hazel Technologies
es Thanks for having me, Vonnie. Good to be here.
Vonnie Estes, IFPA
Yeah, so let's start talking about food waste throughout the produce supply chain. We know it's a problem on the farm, is food waste, primarily a production problem?
Aiden Mouat, Hazel Technologies
es I don't think so. And I think the data would suggest that we're kind of in an era where we've built up our food supply chain or food system to over produce in order to compensate for efficiency challenge as food moves down the supply chain. So, you think about sort of the centralized agricultural model, California being an excellent example in the United States, where you have a large quantity of agriculture condensed into sort of one coast of the entire country, that then radiates distribution outwards to the rest of the country, that I'm just talking to domestic supply chains here. You know, when you have that model, you start to put pressure on food in the post-harvest phase, and that those pressures really, I think, are what are driving food waste. So, from a sort of a theoretical perspective on the supply chain, if we can figure out a way to mitigate those pressures from a supply chain technology basis, we could actually, theoretically reduce the overall quantity of production in favor of reducing waste at the farm gate as well, I actually think it kind of flows backwards from the supply chain itself.
Vonnie Estes, IFPA
So, what role does innovation play to reduce waste throughout the supply chain, as you said?
Aiden Mouat, Hazel Technologies
es I think both historically, and from a from sort of a future perspective, innovation has a key paradigm shifter in how we get food from point A to point B. And, you know, not to go too deep into the history of everything. But you know, things that we think of is commonplace today, things like end-to-end cold chain or airflow control in conventional storage. Those used to be Technologiescal revolutions, actually, well, they are in some other countries.
Aiden Mouat, Hazel Technologies
es As well, that's a whole other Yeah, yeah, not to take a US centric view. A lot of the world could honestly, let me actually use that in the context of your question. A lot of the world doesn't have those, what we would consider standard infrastructural pieces of technology. And so, the result, we have an opportunity to skip a step in the trillions of dollars of infrastructure worldwide, that would require in order to reduce food waste, by using higher power, higher order innovations in order to reduce food waste instead. So, I think I don't think there could be a bigger frontier than sort of the classic example of new Technologieses, shifting the supply curve to the right to use, you know, conventional macroeconomic demand model. That's what the role of innovation really is in the food system.
Vonnie Estes, IFPA
And I think looking at as you're talking about the cold chain and that whole Supply Chain the way it is in the US. That's what we have. And that's what we have to work with. And so, when we think about bringing new technology, and we're not in the US, we're not going to replace all that. So how do we bring new Technologieses in that kind of lessen the problem while still working within that supply chain that we have?
Aiden Mouat, Hazel Technologies
es Yeah, I mean, I think that really is the that's the innovators dilemma in in postindustrial settings. I mean, it's a critical issue. You know, one way to talk about it from sort of a framework perspective, but the way that we think about it, the way that I think about it, and we meeting Hazel, it every time you sort of build a new component of a supply chain, a machine or a piece of infrastructure, essentially a permanent piece of technology or engineering, you're shaping the food supply chain to go through that checkbook. And that oftentimes can obsolete other equipment that can change the standard of production technology in specific supply chains, etc., etc., often leading to this sort of invest in replace cycle, which certainly has its place. I mean, technology continues to grow, there are certainly better pieces of H back equipment, you know, today than there were 10 years ago, etc. But I think a more powerful form of innovation is the one that doesn't intersect with that invest in replaced cycle. It's one where you can have an additive technology much in the way that if you think about digital architecture, you have a technology stack, the operational resources stay the same, but you increase the efficiency of the application, by increasing the layers of digital technology, we look at it the same way there have there has to be room within the existing architecture to create better solutions that don't rely solely on that architecture to deliver results. So, I think that's the real innovative challenge there.
Vonnie Estes, IFPA
Yeah, and real challenge, because you can't if someone has already invested so much money, the switching cost, if you ask them to completely change over to some other different system, you know, the switching cost is going to keep them from doing that. So, if you can do something that's more additive, which I think brings us to Hazel. So why don't you talk a little bit about Hazel, and what the company does and what innovation you've brought and how it fits within the system that we're that we have now.
Aiden Mouat, Hazel Technologies
es Yeah, well, let me contextualize it to within the that particular question, you know, we wanted to find a way to add to the tech stack of standard operations in the supply chain today, whether they're in the postindustrial setting, or whether it's in a more global context, an area that's perhaps a little bit less infrastructural heavy. And so, the opportunity that we saw to do that was through controlling conventional biochemical signaling pathways in perishable food, the nature of perishable food is such that it is alive. And that's true even of things like cut meats, where the this is a bit of a rough analogy, but you can think of a piece of meat as essentially just a very injured animal. And that's a horrible way of framing of it from a biological perspective, it's actually fairly accurate. So if you'll forgive me the macabre analogy, the point being when you have perishable Yeah, when you have these living processes, they're undergoing aging, they're undergoing interactions with other biological organisms in the environment, Moby's that's, and so we got interested in figuring out if we could find a way to control those processes from within the storage and transit system, there are plenty of post-harvest controls, various chemical applications, things of that nature that have been done for many years, kind of at the point of harvest, and in maybe bulk post-harvest settings. But nobody has ever really tried to apply active biochemistry into the storage and transit piece to try to extend those shelf life and preservation benefits as the food moves downstream. So we said, well, you know, everything comes packed in something, whether it's a box, whether it's a reefer whether it's got to move from point A to point B, is there a way we can make an integration, so to speak of biochemistry integration, where we can activate that storage environment and use it to control the things that are limiting perishable food shelf life. And that's where we came up with this idea of creating packaging materials and packaging material inserts, that are that contain an active chemistry released volatile actives into the storage atmosphere of the food. So we don't have to be beholden to a spray type system, something that requires one to one food contact, something that has to go through a new piece of engineering, kind of the sort that I mentioned earlier, but rather something that could be dropped in into any environment in the world, any packaging, and any crop of any kind that responds to that biochemistry therefore is a is a part of the market that can benefit from it. And so that's what we did we created sachets pads, papers, things that contain storage materials that we have incorporated an active ingredient into and then can control the release of that in storage environments for perishable food and use that to control the aging process. And so how
Vonnie Estes, IFPA
difficult was it when you first started going out and Finding partners to work with and even in your beginning sales. Was this a story that that people say, oh, that makes sense. And they adopted it immediately. How did that early trialing period go?
Aiden Mouat, Hazel Technologies
es It's a good question that is partially answered by the fact, we got off to a bit of a false start, when we, when we thought we had identified our key market and key market partners in deploying the technology, we kind of started way downstream in the distribution and retail segments. And to be honest, no, we didn't get a lot of traction. And I don't think that was the fault of anybody that we were working with. I think that the truth is that those types of Technologieses, distributors, retailers, etc., they're not used to seeing that type of technology. And they don't have a clear use case for how they would deploy it. The workforce isn't oriented that way, their supply chains are a little bit ex post facto, etc. So we learned that lesson, this was back in 2016, honestly, and we decided that we wanted to work directly with the folks that are fully upstream, the growers, the Packers, the supply side of the when we got there, and we started getting out to farmland and actually working with directly with farmers and packers, we found they are aware of the problem. I mean, I think that there's nobody in the world that's more aware of food waste than the people that produce and sell the food. And so, we felt that we were addressing a problem that these customers really did have. And they were very quick to test. And when they saw the benefits of the technology very quick to start deployment. And that's really kind of the story of Hazel. That's fascinating,
Vonnie Estes, IFPA
because I actually didn't know exactly who you were you started with your customer base. So how did you have? How do you get them to buy the product? And what's the return on investment? Is it that there's less shrink? So, they, but the shrink happens later? A lot? So how do they actually get paid? And how do they get a return on investment in the product?
Aiden Mouat, Hazel Technologies
es You know, identifying the key lead value proposition, I think was probably how we got traction in the market. And it was to realize that if you're selling a technology, that's just waste reduction, that's good, right? That's not a bad thing. But it might be difficult to get people excited about waste reduction, because waste means a lot of things to a lot of different people, I think the example that I always use is, you know, to a consumer waste might mean well, you know, I don't want to throw away anything that I buy, I want to make sure that I can eat every single thing that that I buy, to, to grow waste means having a place to sell the thing that you grow, because otherwise, you're not going to be able to get it off your land, you might have already grown it and they might have nowhere to go, you might not be able to economically justify being able to move that piece of food. So, you know, we were dealing with different participants in the supply chain, we needed to understand how to speak the language that would be most meaningful to them in a waste reduction context. And so, we actually started focusing not on the drag that is waste reduction, but rather how can we help them grow their businesses and promote their businesses sustainably, but still have an opportunity for growth with this new technology that we're using. So, the flip side of waste reduction is quality extension, its radius extension, it's being able to reach new markets, it's being able to out price your competition because you have higher quality food because you have better tasting food because you have less waste in front of your customers like retailers’ industry. And I think the other key point there is making sure that the unit economics of the product match the market segment you're selling to so we didn't want to go to we didn't want to go to retailers with a solution that was super expensive, and say, hey, you know, push this on your customers push or push this on your suppliers, we thought that was going to be a losing battle. So rather than that, we went to the suppliers, and we said, well, we want to understand your side of the market and we want to sell you a product that the price point is right for the ROI you're getting from the product. You don't have to get anybody's permission to use it, you're going to see the reason to use it right away. And they said oh yeah, you know, at these prices you're talking about we see these benefits, but the benefits aren't just hey, you can reduce waste X percent it's you can increase your production capacity and sell into farther markets. It's you can have the latest season fruit out there that still quality, you could be the only person in the market sometimes if you're selling in the right place in the right category. Those are huge business drivers. And sometimes you're talking about doubling top line revenue in a particular SKU. And that becomes very exciting for these customers to be able to grow their business in that way but to do it in a way that is inherently lower waste. So that was that was one of the big key revelations.
Vonnie Estes, IFPA
Yeah, that makes a lot of sense. What crops are you currently working in now?
Aiden Mouat, Hazel Technologies
es Well, quite a few. We are heavy on pretty much all the major fruits in North and South American production currently so all the orchard fruits apple pear cherry, pretty much across the board and stone fruit so plum peach apricot Nectarine, most of the melons. We're doing a huge push in grapes right now in table grapes. That we have one of the probably one of the only new market Technologieses that is very well studied to improve grapes shelf life and so we're deploying that heavily in the North and South America now and soon to be North Africa as well. We've got a couple of vegetables we've done some leafy green work we've done some we're moving into a we just did a launch in limes, we've done a ton of avocado work both on the hasp varieties in the grand scheme for I mean, so we're, we cover Oh, and of course, I should also mention the wide range of tropicals as well. So, we're all across tropical dragon fruit, passion, fruit, guava, mango, you know, etc., etc. And then, you know, we've got a couple of commercial launches coming out this year as well. So, berries are on deck for this organic grape, papaya, etc., etc. So, we've got a pretty heavy program, a large number of crops.
Vonnie Estes, IFPA
Wow, that's comprehensive. Is the sachet any different that goes into these different crops? Or is it the same?
Aiden Mouat, Hazel Technologies
es The we try to keep the same form factor, meaning for the most part, we like the sachets to look. But I should also point out by the way, we have many skews, we don't just sell sachets we have you know, things that trade controlled atmosphere warehouses and things that trade bins and yada So, but you know, across the different crop categories that are packed out in the MasterCase pallet type configurations, we like the form factor to look the same. Now, that doesn't mean they're getting the same chemistry every single time, we do have the ability to control and optimize the dose rates that we deliver on a per unit biomass at a per unit respiration, honestly. So, you're talking different crops have different respiration rates, etc. That knowledge base that technical sales pace is something that comes along with product deployment. And so, we work heavily with our customers to understand how to do those applications where those differences lie, it might seem as simple as just putting a sachet in a box. But you'd be surprised how, you know if you do it right after harvest versus you know, a holding period versus a cooling period versus what you might actually see different results. And so, we work with our customers to understand how that fits into their supply chain system. So yeah, there's there are definitely some differences.
Vonnie Estes, IFPA
So, I'm really intrigued by a new product that you're looking at called Hazel tracks. Can you tell us what that is? And is it scalable? And kind of where are you
Aiden Mouat, Hazel Technologies
es with that shirt? Yeah, trends are fascinating treks is it’s not just one product, it's a shorthand for a new category of technology that we're deploying pre farm gate. So, this is one of our big bridge pieces into the holistic supply chain is now our farmer customers can actually use Hazel products in field to achieve a new category of goal. And what tracks is to get the technical piece out of the way. It's an It's essentially a technology that allows us to obtain genetic information about the status of a harvest cycle in a given crop using a technology called qPCR. quantitative PCR analysis. So, there are some key market issues that we focus on with each iteration of atrax product, the one that we launched in 2018, was into the Kiwi industry. And so, we did a lot of work with that in New Zealand, and then this year, we're expanding into Italy Chela in the US as well, where budbreak and the application of budbreak enhancement is a major challenge to Kiwi farmers in ensuring that they have uniform yield, and therefore you don't want postharvest quality. And so what farmers of Kiwis can do is take a hazel Trek's Kiwi kit, they go to the field, they can take a kiwi, they mash it up, they send us a sample of that Kiwi with whatever level of sampling rate they want, I mean, you can do one to an acre, you can do one every half acre, you can do one every road, we give them a readout within a couple of days that says okay, you know, we understand the key markers of this keyword plant, we're able to tell you that you need to apply your budbreak enhancer in this 72 hour window, that's going to maximize your yield and your post-harvest quality, etc., etc., etc. Customers all of a sudden see a 15% increase in yield per acre, you know, just astronomical. And that's an example of how we leverage that qPCR platform to solve a specific challenge in a specific crop, we have, you know, similar outputs that are coming out this year, and Apple will be doing cherry as well. So, looking at harvest timing for cherry maturity, looking at ethylene production and stored apples to understand when the best time to release apples from their ca environments is etc. etc. But in each case, we're taking a key genetic piece of information from that crop. And we're using it to deliver actionable intelligence to the farmer or to the packer regarding what to do in realistic market situations about that. So that's a brief summary of the direct product.
Vonnie Estes, IFPA
Very cool. So, I'm really looking for a future where data like that that you get goes all the way down the chain to say Walmart and they know what's coming and how long it will last. And there's you know, it really tightens up the whole supply chain and growers get you know, they know what they're going to sell they know the price that they're going to get is that do you think that's a future that's going to come with technology?
Aiden Mouat, Hazel Technologies
es I think so, I mean, I think you have to remember this is a new category of information entirely. You know, there's all kinds of methods for trying to figure out harvest timing, chemical application, timing, storage, timing, etc. Aerial Photography, satellites, infield monitoring, you name it. There are many different ways of approaching it. I'm not familiar with any of those technology models that provides you per parcel granularity on the literal genetic information of an individual crop plant in whatever area you like. And so, we have a, we have the ability to build a database of information, so specific and so quantitative, that it's just a new frontier entirely from what's being done with kind of aggregates overview type data. And I think that the ultimate Gameplan for that is, is how do we use that to not only improve outcomes for the customer directly? But how do we take that as a company that provides shelf-life solutions that provides logistics Information Solutions all up and down the supply chain? How do we take that information? We use that to improve outcomes all the way until the point something gets eaten. So yeah, that's the future that we envisioned for sure.
Vonnie Estes, IFPA
Yeah. Okay, one last question for you. So, what are three things that you think the produce industry needs to do to tackle food waste specifically?
Aiden Mouat, Hazel Technologies
es Yeah, I mean, I think there's a lot of opportunities. One is I'd love to point at the legislation that emerged in California this year regarding food way, position, right. So that's I know, there's a lot of controversy around that as well, because one of the challenges there is that the government sort of said, well, we have to do this. And that's fair. But the only real outlet that's been presented for how you divert organic waste from these large areas is composting, which is fine. But I don't think that's I don't think that's going to be a big enough scale solution for the types of challenges that some of these farmers are facing in terms of their infield and post field waste. So, I think I think the investing in new technology piece is pretty key, I think, being open to solutions that conform to those requirements. I'm using the state of California as an example. But I think, honestly, that's one of the first pieces of legislation I've ever seen that actually addresses food waste as its own category of environmental problems. And I think there's going to be more of that all over the world. So, I think everybody needs to be thinking about how we deploy solutions that address these concerns directly. And that's going to require new technology. I mean, as we started off this conversation, that's the innovation piece, right. I also strongly encourage participation in alternative marketplaces and to be creative with skew generation. So, you know, I know that not everybody's operation is set up this way. And look, I get it, it is what it is. But I think that there are many opportunities arising from companies that are growing out of the idea of how do we do substandard quality food items into other categories, the juices, the packed foods, the cut foods, the even the secondary marketplaces like full harvest, or imperfect produce, or what have you, there are outlets arising where if you're willing to just do the work of putting a new SKU on something that might otherwise go to waste, that's a really good way of making some money off of it, and also diverting food from landfill. And then lastly, I think the engagement pace between farmers and between regulatory bodies, I think is critical. I know that nobody in the farm industry is a stranger to the idea of lobbying and happens with the US farm bill every single year, or every single year that there is a US Farm Bill. But I think that like the California example, we're not going to get better legislative direction. And we're not going to get better programs designed to divert food waste, until farmers can actually tell the people who are making decisions. These are where the problems lie. Here's what we need to help solve the problem. The example that I like to give is, in the early days of the pandemic, and 2020, we had this sort of disaster situation that made no real sense where huge quantities of food were going to waste because the retail environment in the food service environment had shifted dramatically. Meanwhile, you also had through the roof demand at public food distribution, NGOs, all of a sudden, you had this weird situation where demand was super high, and supply was super high. And meanwhile, the government was giving out free money. And the free money did nothing to resolve that issue whatsoever. And so, the question becomes, what could we have done better with those resources? How could we have directed those resources to set up temporary supply chains to improve market out to figure out new ways of distributing food that would otherwise go to waste? I think that might have been a better policy direction, to be completely honest. And I think that if we had the ability to have a good feedback mechanism, or a tighter feedback mechanism between the growing community and the folks that were legislating, you know, both in state government and in federal, that could have been something that we could have avoided or at least mitigated the damage from so those are kind of the three categories that are off the top of my head. Lots of opportunities out there, I think.
Vonnie Estes, IFPA
Yeah. Great. Well, thank you very much for your time and very thoughtful engagement and we'll talk to you again soon.
Aiden Mouat, Hazel Technologies

A letter from Vonnie Estes
VP, AgFood Tech Innovation
Is carbon the new agriculture crop? An increasing awareness and concern about the environment, changes in government policy, America’s re-entry into the Paris Agreement, and a robust demand for carbon offsets all point toward climate-friendly practices and carbon credits for producers.
However, there are many questions on the efficacy of carbon farming and its worth to the farmer. Will there be incentives to attract enough farmers for it to work? How much trouble will it be to implement and monitor these carbon capture methods? Will some farmers benefit more than others? Will farmers be credited for the actions they have already taken to reduce greenhouse gas emissions? Is this possible for fruit and vegetable producers or only broad acre crops?
“The Carbon Issue” is part of the our Think Tank series, which cultivates relationships and creates traction across the supply chain by exploring ways to break down silos and build bridges for issues facing you, your business, and our industries. It is designed to collectively unlock new and bold thinking to support companies and leaders as they frame future plans and reimagine how to work together to grow our industries. Our Think Tanks bring people together in meaningful ways to build relationships, understanding, connection, and inspiration for each of us as leaders to create sustainable changes that serve all of us.
We convened experts from industry, nonprofits, and academia to explore and learn more about carbon, soil carbon sequestration, and views on potential carbon credits to help our members better understand the potential value to them (monetary and otherwise). We also sought to learn how to support members from an information and advocacy perspective. What does the produce industry need to create for companies to engage in the larger, emerging carbon marketplace? How do we get people into the conversation and move them through it? Our conversation, outlined below, shows that although daunting, this presents a huge opportunity. Some of us feel like we are missing the opportunity. But the truth is for the produce industry the opportunity is just beginning and we have the potential to design it for ourselves. Please join the conversation with us.

Communications
Information must be understandable, relevant, compelling, and trusted by all. From novices – even those who don’t have the carbon issue on their radar – to experts, we need to meet people where they are. We need to make commitment around carbon capture the easy choice.
The issue is complex, and complexity can put people offUnderstanding the issue and business relevance is an important first step for any company. Some examples for trying to simplify the message for carbon sequestration we discussed:
This is how we are removing carbon from the atmosphere.
Carbon reduction efforts are ways for growers to increase profitability and improve their soil.
JargonJargon can be a barrier to engagement. It should be avoided or well-explained where it cannot be avoided. Some jargon demystified is at the end of this document.
Support and trusted advisersIt is important to build a support system for growers (and others) that lays out their opportunities and looks at how they can engage individually and/or collectively.
The big pictureFarmers are stewards of the land, and we must illustrate the full complement of benefits to making these changes. We have to talk about carbon not as singular thing, but as part of many benefits to sustainable farming practices and regenerative agriculture. We do this to improve soil health, and that yields many benefits beyond carbon credits. The opposite is true as well – we have to explain the downsides if we don’t engage.
Marketing and greenwashingMarketers want the ability to make substantiated market claims so they can differentiate their products.
Motivation
Some approach carbon sequestration and other sustainability efforts as simply the right thing to do. Some see it as an economic opportunity.
Financial considerations
For growers, this comes back to finances.
Costs will be the key driver and will vary by operation.
Other revenue opportunities: Some type of product label to generate credit for producers. Investors to buy in. Corporate responsibility funds willing to invest.
Government programs like the California Healthy Soils Program or USDA’s EQIP program that have financial payments for growers.
Some crops have great sequestration potential, and we just don’t know all the details around that yet. We need to figure out how this makes money.
Business case
The ability to survive increasingly erratic weather patterns.
The investment in land, which is a long-term advantage with few short-term motivations vis a vis costs.
We need to focus on regenerative ag. Carbon capture is just one benefit. One grower related the story of how his company embraced regenerative ag because it is a balanced production method that improves the soil and the environment. It also offers the opportunity to be more profitable and to differentiate the business. It helped that they got information from other growers. Farmers trust other farmers.
Saving money, e.g. recycled water, extracting CO2 from natural gas use. Another grower related that saving CO2 is saving his company money. He recycles water, recharges it and sends back out. He said that is great for the environment (not feeding the algae bloom) and a money-saver as he can reuse the lake water because it has no fertilizer in it.
Another example is a greenhouse operation that extracts the CO2 it generates from natural gas use and uses it for the crops that need it. In the past, they bought liquid CO2, so this is a savings for the company and the environment.
Collaboration and shared risk An impact can be made with resources, partners, the ability to share the risk. Changing production methods is risky, and growers will not want to risk existing benefits (e.g. practices required to participate in existing government programs) with new methods unless the benefit is clear. PMA thinkTank 2021 7 Motivation Some approach carbon sequestration and other sustainability efforts as simply the right thing to do. Some see it as an economic opportunity. pma.com C 6
BuyersParticipants stressed the importance of the marketplace, buyer requirements, and consumer demands.
Buyers willing to work with producers to ensure future availability of particular products. Producers respond to buyers’ requests, provided they can still make a profit to stay in business.
We need to understand the consumer pull, which influences the retail pull; that will have an impact on growers’ willingness to change practices.
How can marketers/sellers communicate this in a sales presentation so the buyer gets it. They need to be able to talk about it – to retailers and to consumers. They will want them to understand that the company is working to reduce carbon in the atmosphere and improve the soil. They need a simple, powerful message so the buyer sees their company and their products as unique.
Regulatory compliance or preventionRegulations vary by state, region, and country, and companies must cope with those, especially as they increase to address societal problems like water availability/access. Some believe that industry action around sustainability and climate change, including carbon sequestration, could prevent future, more-onerous government intrusion.
Proof points We need to create quick wins and show results, showcase leaders. Others will follow when they see real-world examples of success. Companies need to see the value proposition up front.
Challenges & Opportunities
Hidden within every challenge is an opportunity to address that challenge. Participants talked about factors that limit quick or widespread adoption of remediation – lack of data, uniqueness of the industry, supply chain implications, marketing, scale, and more.
ProductionFrom patience to diversity, participants raised several considerations around the path forward for producers.
Produce and floral are not the same as row crops, not a monolith. There are different crops with different production needs/methods, different production areas that require adaptations, climate considerations that affect production methods, and varying local/ national rules.
Permanence of soil capture. How do we verify sequestration of carbon?
Patience We must prepare for this to take a few years as growers will try these changes in a small area – pilots, trial plots. If they see the benefits over a couple of years, they’ll transition the new practices to greater acreage. They will also look to academia and industry organizations for data and results before making wholesale changes.
ScaleOn any given acre there’s a finite amount of carbon sequestration, but when looking at the bigger acreage, it can add up. We need to get measurement cost and accuracy. No one has figured out how to implement these principles in produce production at scale. At the smallest scale and beyond, it can be very manual, one-acre farmers growing intense, diverse crops, labor-intense, hand-harvested. How do we scale that? We must scale to make a dent.
Part of a bigger conversation
Part one: Carbon is an issue unto itself, but it’s also one part of broader issues companies address – sustainability, regenerative agriculture, climate change, etc. Carbon must be addressed in context.
Part two: The full supply chain is a missing piece of the conversation. And that splits into two conversations as well: any company’s own efforts to reduce carbon as well as their demands on suppliers. This requires collaboration and teamwork. Produce has more issues on the post-harvest side between farm and the market – distribution, transportation, storage, point-of-sale, even all the way to the consumer. There may be a lot of opportunities throughout the system/chain. Having a good life-cycle assessment (LCA) is important. PMA thinkTank 2021 9 Challenges & Opportunities Hidden within every challenge is an opportunity to address that challenge. Participants talked about factors that limit quick or widespread adoption of remediation – lack of data, uniqueness of the industry, supply chain implications, marketing, scale, and more. pma.com C 6
Part three: The issue of waste is part of this conversation as well. Supply chain mismatches can create waste (supply-demand issues). Perishability of both crops and markets, physical and economic. Not only do these products have a limited shelf life, there is also pricing volatility. Crops may not be harvested, or they may be lost in supply chain.
Data, or lack thereof Data, and their implications, is essential, both from a macro perspective (by industry) and a micro perspective at the company or even field level. We need to understand the existing carbon footprint as an industry and as companies – where emissions come from, how to reduce them. There are many players in the data space, but produce is so diverse, and there’s a lack of trust. It’s easy to get row-crop data, but not so much for specialty crops. Plus there are different data needs for different programs. What is the burden on the producer when they look at the plethora of data-gathering, data-management, and data-analysis needs? So Carbon data must be considered in the bigger data management scheme for growers. Knowing what data will be needed is important. This goes beyond government or regulatory data needs; the marketplace – buyers and consumers – also require transparency around these issues.
Data: how to get it, how to use it
As the saying goes: You can’t manage what you don’t measure. USDA has some tools. They are conservative, but trusted, and could be a resource for the on-farm needs. How do we measure and analyze? How can we create systems (internally or by crop or industry) that allow relevant data comparison, benchmarks?
Tylers's Story
Tyler Nuss talks about the journey his dad and Nuss Farms made to embrace regenerative agriculture and soil health. And how that is the best lens to look through for carbon capture.

Glossary
The group discussed the amount of jargon used around carbon capture that adds to the confusion. Here is a short glossary of commonly used terms and concepts that hopefully helps clear the fog.
To avoid giving credits to projects that would have happened anyway, rules have been specified to ensure additionality of the project i.e. to ensure the project captures carbon more than would have occurred in the absence of the project. A project is additional if its proponents can document that realistic alternative scenarios to the proposed project would be more economically attractive or that the project faces barriers that carbon finance helps it overcome.
A carbon credit represents ownership of the equivalent of one metric ton of carbon dioxide that can be traded, sold or retired. If an organization is regulated under a cap-and-trade system (e.g., the California Cap and Trade Program) it likely has an allowance of credits it can use towards its cap. If the organization produces fewer tons of carbon emissions than it is allocated, the organization can trade, sell or hold the remaining carbon credits. When a credit is sold, the buyer is purchasing the seller’s allowance of emissions.
CO2 is a colorless, odorless, non-poisonous gas that is a normal part of the ambient air. Of the six greenhouse gases normally targeted, CO2 contributes the most to human-induced global warming. Human activities such as fossil fuel combustion and deforestation have increased atmospheric concentrations of CO2 by approximately 30 percent since the industrial revolution. CO2is the standard used to determine the “global warming potentials” (GWPs) of other gases. CO2 has been assigned a 100-year GWP of 1 (i.e., the warming effects over a 100-year time frame relative to other gases).
A carbon offset represents a real reduction of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere and results in the generation of a carbon credit. The difference from a carbon credit is that the credit is generated as the result of a project with clear boundaries, title, project documents and a verification plan. In most cases, carbon offsets generate reductions outside of the organization and, more importantly, outside of any regulatory requirement. Common projects include building wind farms, supporting truck stop electrification projects to reduce tailpipe emissions, and planting trees or preserving forests.
Farming in a way that reduces greenhouse gas emissions in its production processes, while increasing carbon sequestration in the landscape. May include single management changes, such as no-till cultivation or grazing management, to a whole farm integrated management plan. Benefits include carbon sequestration, reduced erosion and soil loss, healthier soils, vegetation and animals, greater water efficiency and the production of carbon offsets.
The removal of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and storage in another system, such as vegetation. If the carbon dioxide sequestered is more than the carbon dioxide emitted, the store is increasing and is known as a carbon sink.
(CSA) is an approach to help the people who manage agricultural systems respond effectively to climate change. The CSA approach pursues the triple objectives of sustainably increasing productivity and incomes, adapting and building resilience to climate change and reducing greenhouse gas emissions where possible. This does not imply that every practice applied in every location should produce “triple wins”. Rather the CSA approach seeks to reduce trade-offs and promote synergies by taking these objectives into consideration to inform decisions from the local to the global scales and over short and long time horizons, to derive locally-acceptable solutions
The USDA web-based tool to help farmers interested in transitioning to carbon-sequestering practices.
Refers to the situation where a carbon sequestration activity (e.g., tree planting or avoided deforestation) on one piece of land inadvertently, directly or indirectly, triggers an activity, which in whole or in part counteracts the carbon effects of the initial activity.
An offset quality criterion which relates to the robustness and durability of the emission reduction generated by a carbon offset project.
Farming and grazing practices that, among other benefits, reverse climate change by rebuildingsoil organic matter and restoring degraded soil biodiversity – resulting in both carbon drawdownand improving the water cycle.
The Carbon Story
The produce industry can help mitigate consequences of climate change by capitalizing on emerging sustainability financing. This allows the supply chain to implement practices that provide environmental benefits even though currently there is no federal scheme for cap and trade of carbon.
76%
of the total greenhouse gas emissions were from carbon dioxide
82.9 million metric tons
of carbon dioxide was emitted by U.S. agriculture, ~10 percent of total U.S. greenhouse gas emissions
Practices that sequester carbon and can be adopted by specialty crop growers:
No-till
Cover crops
Direct seeding
Field windbreaks
Rotational grazing
Perennial crops
Reduced summer fallow
Growing higher yielding varieties
Converting marginal crop land to grass or forest
Drip irrigation
Center-pivot irrigation
Recapturing methane from manure lagoons
Benefits to Produce Industry
Carbon Financing: earn monetary compensation for sequestered carbon
Soil Carbon Bills & Soil Health Programs: receive funding for the transition to sequestering carbon or other sustainable production methods
Sustainable Tax Credits: save money by following specific environmentally friendly criteria
Green & Social Bonds: funding for projects that benefit the environment and minimize the environmental impact of agricultural production

A letter from Vonnie Estes
VP, AgFood Tech Innovation
I started working on integrated pest management (IPM) about 25 years ago. It concerns me that 25 years later, much of the articles and information about IPM still come from universities and governments. It still has not been widely adopted by commercial industry and production, and that’s troubling.
Should IPM be considered on its own? Or should it be folded into discussions around regenerative agriculture or sustainability overall? And what about communications? We need to consider communications within the industry, including all stakeholders, as well as consumers.
The intent of this Think Tank is to explore and understand the benefits and concerns about using and communicating IPM practices through the supply chain. We also want to learn how to best support our members from an information and advocacy perspective.
International Fresh Produce Association (IFPA) is continuing the Think Tank series on important science and technology issues as a way to connect stakeholders, guide discussions and learnings, and advocate for appropriate outcomes.
The Think Tanks cultivate relationships and explore ways to break down silos and build bridges for issues facing you, your business, and our industries. They are designed to unlock new and bold thinking to support companies and leaders as they frame future plans and reimagine how to work together to grow our industries. They bring people together to build relationships, understanding, connection, and inspiration to create sustainable changes that serve everyone.
IFPA convened IPM experts for this Think Tank, and we thank everyone who participated, helping us provide a platform around this important and evolving topic. See what our experts had to say on IPM, and please join the conversation.
Vonnie
Integrated pest management (IPM) means considering all available pest control techniques and other measures that discourage the development of pest populations, while minimizing risks to human health and the environment, according to the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations.For producers, IPM combines cultural, biological, and chemical methods to manage pests, including insects, diseases, and weeds. It considers relevant, locally available controls, evaluating their potential cost-effectiveness.
IPM Covers Three Key Areas
Prevention
Monitoring
Intervention
IPM does not, however, consist of any absolute or rigid criteria. It is a flexible system that makes good use of local resources and the latest research, technology, knowledge, and experience.
Several themes reverberated throughout the IPM discussions:
Communications – within the industry and with consumers
Research and updates
Perceptions and image of IPM
Policy and the upcoming U.S. Farm Bill
Economics, especially for growers
The Conversation
Full supply chain understanding is essential
There’s a perception – even a myth – that IPM is stagnant and not producing outcomes as intended. We haven’t had a good discussion about IPM since the Food Quality Protection Act in the late 1990s. It’s time to sit down and talk. And we have to figure out how to talk about it in context with similar issues – regenerative ag, sustainability, organics and more.
Responding to demand
Growers respond to demands from retailers and consumers. As the retail landscape becomes more concentrated, those demands are also more concentrated, sometimes appearing as a mandate. IPM may be the appropriate practice for certain crop-pest combinations but not for others. Buyers and retailers usually don’t know what companies are doing with IPM. Growers can educate buyers through videos or hosting buyers on field visits, explaining production priorities and why IPM is an important tool, though not the only tool. Growers understand the opportunities pest control advisers and crop consultants offer. These are specialists, licensed professionals who undertake ongoing education to maintain their certifications. They manage insects, disease, weeds, and more in the field. And we should broaden the conversation, letting retailers and consumers know about these specialists, and how growers take advantage of this scientific and technical expertise.
Grower considerations and support
Growers need assistance – people to translate these tools for them. A key education pathway is the extension service.
Let’s talk
Participants agreed it’s time to convene a multistakeholder process, talk about IPM, its role in ecosystem services, and meeting the needs of agriculture.
Participants suggested the International Fresh Produce Association as a platform and convener for information, insights, and education. They noted that conversations must happen soon to be prepared to include IPM in the U.S. 2023 Farm Bill. These conversations should follow two paths:
Discussions – among growers, but also among the whole supply chain to broaden understanding and break down silos.
Grower panels that can highlight successes and failures so all can learn about IPM complexities, implementation, etc.
The Conversation
Consumers should be a target audience
Consumers don’t know about IPM. They think about sustainability and organics. We haven’t talked enough about the successes of IPM. We need to talk about what we can do and what we are doing.
Participants in the Think Tank noted the lack of connection between consumers and the processes that deliver IPM as well as the need to increase ag literacy in this space. The industry must do better job of explaining how we deliver on this, including how IPM fits into broader consumer conversations about sustainability or organics or even regenerative agriculture. In communications to inform the public about what IPM is and how it’s relevant to their lives, we need to make it approachable without getting so simplistic that it seems like greenwashing.
Research, updates and investment must increase
How do we execute IPM better? What are the latest advancements? For IPM to work it must be about continuous improvement, using new technologies, etc. Some of the technologies and practices are 30 years old. We need research and updates.
It’s been a while since we advanced the discussion on tools that are available now and the research that’s needed. We need collective research – no one company can do this on its own. In addition, we need to understand consumers’ perceptions. Retailers are interested in how consumers respond to hot button issues. Research funding has been successful in the past. Collaboration among U.S. government agencies, academia and growers is good, but funding has slacked off in recent years. With the next wave of investment, will new solutions be as robust as what they are replacing, and will they appeal to consumers? What are the new tools and technologies? How do we add to our toolkit? If we’re going to lose existing tools, how can we be replacing them? Universities have IPM coordinators, whose role is education, and there’s a coordinator in every state. The land-grant university system is available to everyone, and there are four regional IPM centers. Participants noted there is an IPM symposium in Denver in February.IPM is not a one-size-fits-all situation, though there are some commonalities that can be applied. A challenge for IPM research, outreach and education is the need to refine what is known and apply it to specific crops, which is difficult because of crop and regional variations. Years ago, stakeholders got together and created a federal IPM roadmap. California also has a good IPM roadmap. Having area-wide programs is desired, but it can be hard to get all growers on board.
Policy and the upcoming U.S. Farm Bill – include IPM
We need to act at the policy level. There’s an opportunity in the Farm Bill for ecosystem incentives for growers in this area. If we don’t speak up, it’ll be all about carbon sequestration in the next Farm Bill. We need to advocate for IPM so we don’t miss this opportunity.
When it comes to policy discussions, we don’t hear much about IPM anymore. IPM is a spectrum and less black-and-white, so it’s harder to grasp and address. We must identify what would help IPM compete for dollars, resources, and attention on the policy front. Stakeholders, especially on the production side, must communicate with legislators and policy makers who must hear from everyone, not just the loudest voices.
Economics, especially for growers
The science around IPM is strong and well-known. What’s missing is the economics at farm level. Farmers wouldn’t hesitate if the economics worked. Ultimately, growers ask: Am I doing enough to help in the right ways?
Growers must evaluate the IPM measures they undertake to determine whether they are effective and efficient at achieving production and pest-control goals. They must also evaluate whether these measures are economically viable for their farms. However, broader effectiveness must be assessed as well. One grower working on pest suppression through IPM often faces additional pest pressures if neighboring farms are not using adequate controls. To get true societal benefit and enhance cost-effectiveness for all, a regional approach is often needed. Will durable solutions that have been commercialized remain available? Will new technologies on the horizon deliver the same kind of controls? Can the next generation of IPM tools save money by reducing costs and deliver what some technology has not – less dependency on inputs? Finally, the financial impact of diverse certifications also affects the grower’s bottom line, not unlike the pressures growers have faced with food safety requirements and audits.
Consumers drive a lot of expectations, and retailers specify which certification scheme they want growers to be judged against based on those expectations. Growers and shippers want to satisfy consumer demand, but having so many certifications is difficult – both in execution and in documentation. The cost of third-party audits further complicates this.

This article was first published in Produce Blue Book on Jan. 20, 2022.
On an ""Innovating Our Way Out of a Food Crisis"" panel, Vonnie Estes of IFPA speaks with Michael Wolf from the Spoon, Suma Reddy from Future Acres, and Anne Palermo from Aqua Cultured Foods.
CES has been around for 54 years and has historically been the place tech giants make big product announcements. In 2020 at the last live event, CES had 180,000 attendees.
This year there was reduced attendance at 45,000 due to COVID. Many of big tech and big media outlets pulled out, leaving large empty show rooms and some presentations pre-recorded.
But there were still 2,300 exhibitors and 30 percent of show’s attendees traveled internationally from 190 countries. With the show not being dominated by tech giants this year, smaller and international players were better able to reach audiences and industry partners.
Some say CES will persist with and the proportion of true innovation to just iteration will increase.
However, the main reason the International Fresh Produce Association was there was the emergence of Food Tech as a new category. CES has in the past been focused mostly on TV’s, phones, cars and other gadgets, but with the year we’ve had there was increased focus on the convergence of technology with health and food.
We saw five big themes at CES that are also big themes in the produce industry. This illustrates that our industry is keeping pace with technology and has the same benefits along with challenges in technology adoption.
Health and wellness
The health-care sector had been growing its presence at CES for the last few years, and the pandemic has supercharged that trend. But more than strictly medical devices, the tech on display at this year’s show demonstrated how technology is making consumer gadgets that monitor health and wellness a bigger part of many people’s everyday lives.
There was more focus on increased balance, health and wellness and how to better manage all aspects of life. An example is the glucose-monitoring wearable for athletes, the Libre Sense, that Abbott Labs promoted in CES’ first-ever healthcare keynote.
Technology that allows us to grow, transport, store, procure, prepare and eat food was highlighted at the show for the first time. There was technology focused on food tech, personalization, and the connected kitchen. The Spoon held a half day of content on Food Tech. So between innovation on the show floor and panels, Food Tech arrived at CES.
Sustainability
Sustainability considerations and goals have become imbedded in most companies, both in the produce industry and beyond. It is no longer just one person’s title or a department, but what the organization does. At CES we saw corporates and small start-ups alike showcasing sustainable technologies.
With Tesla’s success in mind and consumers increasingly choosing electric vehicles (EVs), along with stronger related regulations coming, it’s little wonder that many firms are accelerating their EV plans.One of the ways this will impact the produce industry is with last mile delivery of e-commerce. GM is developing a fleet of vans to help decarbonize delivery and is partnering with food delivery providers. These vans will greatly decrease the carbon footprint of e-commerce.
Around one-third of the food produced globally each year is wasted and awareness of how this challenge contributes to other social and environmental challenges including climate change, is growing.
Several solutions from international companies were presented at CES, including Orbisk – an AI-powered food waste monitoring system and Uvera, which is developing a food storage system that uses UVC light to extend the shelf life of food. We also did a panel on food waste with Hazel Technologies and Clew shining the the spotlight on food waste solutions in our industry.
Collaborations
Throughout all industries including ours, technology is becoming more sophisticated and specific. It is impossible for say a robotics startup to develop and master all types of hardware and software for a successful robot.
Companies with different expertise need to collaborate with each other to rapidly respond to shifts in the marketplace caused by factors such as climate change. At CES we saw large collaborations with companies like GM and Abbott. The produce industry is developing models that are a lot more collaborative across platforms to solve the big challenges we face. The partnership between Plenty and Driscoll’s on indoor strawberries is an example.
Vonnie Estes visits N.Thing, a company working on indoor, modular, vertical farming.
Interoperability
The basic ability of disparate products and services to readily connect and exchange information with one another has mostly not been accomplished across any industry. This is a huge challenge and is often the obstruction of technology adoption and deployment.
At CES the CEO of Samsung talked about the “smart home” where everything in the house talked to each other and was fully connected… from a Samsung phone with all Samsung appliances. We know that is not how the world works.
Throughout produce and other industries, we have sensors that pick up separate information and relay it to a separate dashboard. The user ends up with multiple dashboards not talking to each other and unable to make insightful decisions. This is a global issue that we will work through as the technology develops.
Robotics
A popular component of the CES tradeshow is the long list of companies that have used the event to debut the latest in robotics. Whether they’re increasing safety, improving accuracy or reducing waste, robotics is advancing with impressive speed. We saw many different robots at the show.
For foodservice, we saw robots that greet customers dining at restaurants and bring their pancakes, bacon and eggs to the table. We saw a robot that can learn how to recreate recipes in a restaurant kitchen through sensors that are attached to kitchen utensils to analyze recipes.
Agtech continues to be one of the major categories to watch here. John Deere made the biggest waves with its fully autonomous tractor. Naïo’s vineyard robot also got some attention. It is clear that robots and automation will have continued importance throughout the produce supply chain in helping automate the dirty and dangerous jobs.
There are many technologies available like AI, robotics, computer vision, bioengineering that if applied to the food system, can make a real impact on saving and feeding the planet, probably more quickly than other products.
As an industry, we need to continue to look at innovation outside produce and see what we can bring in to solve our biggest challenges.

Vonnie Estes, PMA:
Welcome to PMA Takes on Tech, the podcast that explores the problems, solutions, people and ideas that are shaping the future of the produce industry. I'm your host, Bonnie Estes, vice president of technology for the produce marketing association. And I've spent years in the agtech sector.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:
So I can attest, it's hard to navigate this ever changing world and developing and adopting new solutions to industry problems. Thanks for joining us and for allowing us to serve as your guide to the new world of produce and technology. My goal of the podcast is to outline a problem in the produce industry and then discuss several possible solutions that can be deployed today.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:
This season of PMA Takes on Tech is brought to you by Plenty. Plenty is an indoor vertical farm that sustainably grows produce using less water and land than traditional farming and no pesticides or GMOs. The farm is able to grow peak season, flavorful food year round and deliver fresh produce to its retail partners, daily.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:
Plenty's proprietary towers and intelligent platform, make it the only vertical farm that can grow multiple crops with consistently superior flavors and yield. Today's conversation is with Dana Worth, senior vice president at Plenty. I originally knew Dana from Impossible Foods, where he spent nearly six years as VP of sales and in business operations.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:
Dana is a wealth of information on commercializing products in mission driven companies in high growth stages. We talk about the push and pull of retailers and consumers for healthy, nutritious food. Let's jump into the conversation with Dana on his role at Plenty and some learnings from Impossible Foods.
Dana Worth, Plenty:
So I run our sales, marketing and comms teams here at Plenty, collectively, we call that the commercial team. I have been at the company since January of 2021, so about 11 months as of now. And it's been a really fun and exciting time, so far. I joined Plenty after spending almost six years at Impossible Foods, just down the road here in California.
Dana Worth, Plenty:
At Impossible Foods, I joined in 2015 as an early commercial hire and has spent a lot of time focused on how to bring our first product there, the impossible burger to market. So when I joined Impossible in 2015, we were still about a year and a half from launching David Chan's restaurant, Momofuku, in New York City in July of 2016.
Dana Worth, Plenty:
And I helped design that launch, build the commercial team. When I first started, it was me. I did everything from answering all the e-customer service emails in the inbox to going on sales calls with a griddle that we'd bought at Walmart and kind of dragged down the street behind us to thinking about securing our first social media, Instagram handle, all the way up through leading the deals with Burger King and Starbucks, which are still standing today for the Impossible Walker and in the Impossible Breakfast Sandwich.
Dana Worth, Plenty:
My interest in the industry really started with Impossible Foods. I had had very little exposure to food and ag prior to Impossible Foods. I'd been working in some healthcare work, I'd been working in emerging markets, I'd been working in FinTech most recently with PayPal, but when I meant Pat Brown and the team over at Impossible, I became really interested in how important the food system is to the planet and the people who live on it.
Dana Worth, Plenty:
And as I've learned more and more about the food system, I've really become convinced that it's pretty much the closest thing we have to a silver bullet to solve many of the problems facing the planet and the people who live here. Conversely, actually one of the things that can be most negatively impactful to the planet, if we don't address some of those issues. The way I think about it is the food system, there are six to seven billion people who are consumers into the system every day for many people, multiple times a day.
Dana Worth, Plenty:
There's another one, two billion people who are producers into the system every single day. It obviously impacts our environment, it impacts human health, impacts the animals who live on this planet as well. And I can't think of a single system. The energy system doesn't do that, the healthcare system, the education system, I can't think of a single system that impacts so many human beings every day.
Dana Worth, Plenty:
And what's interesting to me about that is obviously the chance to have an impact a positive out on the world. So from a mission standpoint, both impossible foods and plenty are mission focused mission first companies, but also as a business person, I mean, what an incredible place to build a business, right? How often do you have the chance to access every human being on the planet as a potential customer?
Dana Worth, Plenty:
Not many businesses can claim that, total addressable market, as say, it's been really interesting watching since 2015, when I entered into the industry, just how much focus has come into the industry. Obviously we all see the headlines about the capital that's been invested and how that's been going up, up, up over recent years.
Dana Worth, Plenty:
I'm of the mind that that's still... We're still massively under investing in the industry. Given the aspects I just mentioned, given how many people are consumers, how many people are producers and how big the challenges are. So I'm sort of a big tenter on this, I believe that it's going to take many, many companies, many, many entrepreneurs, many, many solutions to get to where we need to go, because the scale of the challenge is so great.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:
Yeah. That's... It's so true. And I think, like you said, working for both those companies and having an impact, those are two really impactful areas. So indoor ag is playing an increasingly incremental role in our fresh produce supply. What are the key factors driving this? And is this a fad, as some people think? A very well invested fad, or is it here to stay?
Dana Worth, Plenty:
Yeah. I think there's two, as with any of these trends, there's kind of two sides to this. One is the push and the other is the pull. So I'll start with the pull, which is the consumer. Consumers, aren't out there saying we want indoor ag, right? Most people probably don't even know how their food is grown today, let alone think about, the differences between indoor and outdoor and all the variations thereof.
Dana Worth, Plenty:
But consumers have been voting very strongly over the last couple decades that they do care about how their food is made, even if they don't fully understand it, right? The growth and prominence of organic is a perfect example of consumers caring, right? And consumers, voting their dollars on how they care. My belief is they care about things, obviously taste, right?
Dana Worth, Plenty:
We all know that taste is number one, that being said, everything in the grocery store is designed to be tasty, for the most part, burritos are tasty, ice cream is tasty, there's lots of things that are tasty. So saying that... I think of taste is necessary, but not sufficient condition.
Dana Worth, Plenty:
If you're not tasty, that's going to be a problem. But just because you're tasty doesn't mean that you're going to succeed. The second, really big one, I think, especially in the produce space is cleanliness. And I think there's kind of a lurking unknown in consumer's minds about cleanliness. So what does that mean? Why are some things no need to wash, but some are triple washed and some I have to wash at home and some, what is... There's kind of a... I think a... Like I said, a lurking belief of, I'm not quite sure what exactly is on my produce.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:
And do you think that's tied to food safety, like staying safe with the food that you eat or is it more dirt or is it more insecticides or is it all those things?
Dana Worth, Plenty:
Yeah. I think it probably doesn't... For most consumers doesn't break down into any particular components, more of a, dirty is bad. I'm not quite sure how it's bad. It could be as bad as, my gosh, I could end up sick. And I see these, certainly people are aware of recalls, but it could be as minor as, this looks dirty, right? Even if it's completely harmless.
Dana Worth, Plenty:
The other thing is, I think... Way I think about it is produce in some ways is not a great consumer experience, right? If you were to just step back and think about produce as a product, where else in the grocery store, do you have things that when you get them home, you could have a third or half the pack not be what it was represented to be, right?
Dana Worth, Plenty:
It could be rotten, it could be moldy, it could be something you didn't think you were buying, you also, depending on what time of year you buy it, what time of week you buy it, depending on the store you buy it at, you can get a completely different product, right? A strawberry is not a strawberry, a strawberry can be many different things, depending on when and where you buy it.
Dana Worth, Plenty:
And a product that you often end up throwing a large amount away because it goes bad or goes bad in your fridge. If you think about that in the context of the grocery store, if Cheerios had those... That value proposition, it would be a terrible product, right? Like, Hey, by the way, Cheerios are different depending on where you get them, what time of year you get them, oftentimes they go bad and you don't know exactly what they're going to taste like before you open the packet.
Dana Worth, Plenty:
People wouldn't buy that product. And I actually think it's a testimony to how important produce is in people's lives that people continue to buy produce, even despite all the downsides that come along with that product. And so that's, that's the framework I use for thinking about what can any production system, whether it's indoor ag or otherwise, what are the solutions we can bring to the consumer? It's about making it a more reliable product, it's about making it a cleaner... Put cleaner on quotes, but a 'cleaner' product in consumer's minds about making it a more nutritious product, making it something that I can get what I'm expecting to get.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:
So how do you think what Plenty is doing in your technology can solve that issue, especially around strawberries, since I know you're working on strawberries.
Dana Worth, Plenty:
Yeah. So I think the obvious... One of the obvious solutions here is by being able to provide a consistent environment and being able to control all the knobs like we can at Plenty, we can produce a great strawberry. We believe in conjunction with our partners at Driscolls, year round.
Dana Worth, Plenty:
And it's always a great day as well. Like I say, it's always a great day in Watsonville inside a plenty farm. So as some of your listeners may know, we've been... We have a publicly announced partnership with Driscolls, where we're working with their world class genetics, as well as our world class indoor environment with the goal of producing really game changing strawberries. So that's an area, not the only area, but certainly an area where indoor ag to original question can really deliver some big gains.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:
And are you publicly making any prediction of when I may have Plenty strawberries in my refrigerator?
Dana Worth, Plenty:
I am not publicly making any predictions about Plenty strawberries, but we will get you some point fun.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:
Good. I'm looking forward to that. So how can companies like Plenty increase awareness about CEA among retailers of how it is different from organic or non GMO or many of the other different types of categories?
Dana Worth, Plenty:
Yeah. I think that's a great point and actually comes back to the push side. So we were talking about the pull from the consumer, the push from the retailer. In the long run, the retailers' interest aligned with the consumer's interest, but in the short, medium run, that's not always the case.
Dana Worth, Plenty:
And especially right now with all the supply chain challenges that retailers have had, labor challenges retailers have had, and general COVID challenges retailers have had over the last year and a half, they've got their hands full, for sure. And so they are oftentimes solving for related, but somewhat different things. So, we hear from a lot of retailers that reducing recalls would be a huge benefit to them. Just that is one of the biggest things that disrupts their produce department on a, what seemingly consistent basis that is.
Dana Worth, Plenty:
It's a huge pain point for them. We also hear, consistency, just being able to know when I'm going to have product, know when I'm going to be able to stock my shelves, right? They're trying to run a business, they've got a lot of different pieces to manage and having something that's so volatile makes it really challenging to run that business.
Dana Worth, Plenty:
I've also heard from most produce managers that that's why they love produce by the way that they love... They went into that business because they love the dynamic nature of it. But that is a... It's a constant struggle that they're trying to manage. The other thing we're hearing from retailers is that they want to ensure their supply going forward. So everyone is thinking about, how do I make sure that whether it's supply chain difficulties, whether it's supply related pressures on the field, they want to make sure that, obviously they're going to be able to keep their shelf stocked.
Dana Worth, Plenty:
And as they think towards the future they're looking at controlled environment or indoor agriculture is a way to make sure that they have consistent access to the products that they know their consumers want. So that's what we're hearing from retailers. What's interesting is they're is I think a shared understanding between retailers and other indoor folks or indoor folks that we do need to figure out how to talk to the consumer about this.
Dana Worth, Plenty:
And I'll use an analogy from my Impossible days, until Impossible and Beyond really started coming out with some of the more innovative products that we debuted in the mid 2010. So in 2015, 2016, 2017, everything was a veggie burger, right? Like if you ever had a Dr. Prager's or a morning star burger, those were... It was a veggie burger, that was the term.
Dana Worth, Plenty:
That's what I grew up with around the time that Impossible and Beyond started releasing their products plant based, became... A term that was well... Became better known by consumers to the point, now, when you walk into many retail groceries, you'll see plant-based as a section heading.
Dana Worth, Plenty:
And the interesting thing about plant-based is, plant-based has a lot of positive connotations. So if you were to walk out and grab a consumer out of a grocery store and say, what is plant-based, you'll say, it's probably better for you, better for the environment, something that I try to do, I'm doing my part to try to make my life or the planet's life healthier. And that became kind of a code word, a short code for consumers in a complex grocery store and a way to make decisions. And we haven't had that moment yet for indoor or CEA, neither of those terms mean anything to a consumer.CEA in particular is a pretty terrible consumer term.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:
Yes. Yeah.
Dana Worth, Plenty:
And so one of the things that I think both retailers and.... I certainly recognize, I would imagine other indoor producers recognize is the need to have what I think of as our plant-based moment. Like, what is the term that we can put out into the world that neatly summarizes the value and the benefits to the consumer, as opposed to a description of the production method, which is not particularly useful, CEA or indoor is not particularly useful to the consumer. And organic's an interesting case study where it was a description of a production method that has come to mean something to the consumer. Not because they're necessarily thinking there's a particular process, right?
Dana Worth, Plenty:
But they does have this... It is a term that has this kind of set of benefits behind it, that consumer... I'm sure every consumer thinks about it a little differently, we know many consumers don't think about it correctly, but that's not necessarily important.
Dana Worth, Plenty:
They think of it as this set of benefits that they can count on when they are in the store. And we haven't had that moment yet for what we do. And it's going to be a big part of my focus going forward. And I would invite others in the industry to join me as well. I think it benefits everyone, going back to what I said in the beginning, the challenges we face around the food and ag system are too big to be tackled by any one company alone.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:
So what would that mean to a consumer? If you could communicate, We're growing this indoors or we're growing this vertically, and the consumer would go, that means these benefits, so what kind of benefits are you trying to communicate to them that they would think I want to buy this because of all the... This bucket of benefits?
Dana Worth, Plenty:
Yeah. It goes back to what I was saying about the ways in which produce is kind of a broken product. So it would be you're going to get what it's says on the label. Meaning if it says delicious strawberries, they're delicious strawberries, you're going to get something that is clean, right?
Dana Worth, Plenty:
So if it's no need to wash, it truly is no need to wash and it's not going to be... I can count on it being clean. And I think being clean, we hold ourselves to a standard, for example, we say no pesticides on our product because we believe actually a lot of what consumers want when they're thinking about clean is, is no pesticides and correctly, of course, right? Pesticides are the thing that most consumers should be worried about.
Dana Worth, Plenty:
So that's a big part of it. And then I think the consistency as well. So knowing that... And it's related to getting what it says in the label, but it's a slightly different thing, knowing that I can buy this product 52 weeks a year and I'm going to get something that I or my kids will enjoy.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:
I think for me, your market research of one here is that it's just how long it lasts in the shelf life. And that I know that whatever it says on the label, it's going to last at least till that date and probably longer. And it's going to last longer than a couple of days after I buy it, no matter what. So, I think for me, that's a huge benefit and I think that's one thing that people who grow other ways are going to need to step up a little bit to meet that demand of consumers that, we just have longer shelf lives, especially in supply chains, the way that they are.
Dana Worth, Plenty:
Yeah. And that's a great point. And obviously with indoor, there's a few ways we can address that, putting production closer to consumption is the obvious one, but even more minor things like when we... Because of how we harvest, we're able to go from harvest into a cold tunnel, into refrigeration within seconds, not days, not hours, not days, not the [inaudible 00:18:27] going days, but not hours, right?
Dana Worth, Plenty:
And been doing so we're able to kind of freeze the product in time and get it out to consumers faster. So there's a few... There's the obvious one of location and food miles, but there's also some other things that you can do when you have such tight control over your system.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:
Yeah. So how does this work, you think, as far as where it fits both in how it works in cannibalizing outdoor growing and then I've heard people talk about it. I heard one retailer say, well, I only have room on my shelf for these leafy greens in a package for a certain amount.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:
And so I'm going to take... I'm going to put indoor grown in there and I'm going to get rid of organic, I'm not going to carry organic anymore. So just when you think about... I think my view right now is the pie is continuing to kind of get bigger. We've got great products and the pie is going to get bigger, but that can't go on forever. So at some point the retailer and the consumer is going to have to make a decision of what do I buy? And then how does that affect organic and then outdoor growing? How do you kind of see it shaking out going forward?
Dana Worth, Plenty:
Yeah. I think if you zoom out and think about the retailers store, obviously shelf space is there it's a premium, but it's a little more complicated in produce because refrigerated shelf space is actually the premium, the premium that we're all trading.
Dana Worth, Plenty:
If you listen to every retailers, every public retailers, earnings calls, strategy days, et cetera, fresh, fresh, fresh, fresh, fresh, right? Fresh is their number one priority. Fresh is what brings continues to bring consumers into the store. I joked a few times that fresh is to retail brick and mortar retail, what ESPN is to cable, right? It's the reason why you keep your cable subscription, it's the reason why people keep going into stores. I believe in a future where we're going to, if you're not already, most people will be buying their toilet paper and they're reaper towels online.
Dana Worth, Plenty:
And that they're going to continue to go into the store for things... For meat fish and produce. And retailers have all know this, obviously, that's why they talk about it with their investors, that's why they're making massive investments in the fresh space. And so to put a finer point on your... On about growing the pie. Sure, but literally actually physically talking about growing the sections in the store, right?
Dana Worth, Plenty:
Growing the section, growing the perimeter, growing the refrigerated space in the stores, right? Doing all that to make sure they've got room to bring more fresh in. So there's... I think that's a very real thing. And it aligns very well with retailer strategies right now, there's also within the refrigerated fresh cases, there's, it's not just produce that's in there, right? So there's tradeoffs with other products, so you can even within the given set space you have today, you can expand, produce relative to the other fresh refrigerated items.
Dana Worth, Plenty:
And then there's of course, as you mentioned, trade offs, within the fresh... Within a given set of fresh produce, I think that there's... What's interesting about that is, at least the way we think about it at Plenty is, we can help partner with existing field growers.
Dana Worth, Plenty:
We were down... You and I were both down at Western Growers Association a couple weeks ago, and we were there looking to make friends, not enemies. We believe that we can partner with existing growers to help them grow in this way, because we believe that this is the way forward. And so while you might see, when it gets down to the fine point might see cannibalization again after the third layer down here, but you might see cannibalization between outdoor and indoor grown products.
Dana Worth, Plenty:
Behind that you might see, and we believe you will see outdoor growers investing in indoor grown techniques. And so is that it may not be canalization from the producer side. It may be just a trade up for consumers to product that we believe brings more benefit to the consumer and what they're getting today.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:
Yeah. I think it may end up being just kind of a portfolio of different ways to grow. So I consider myself a producer, I produce these kinds of products, leafy greens or others, and I do it outside here, I do it inside here. So it's just kind of risk mitigation, especially with climate change, I think, and here in California, as we worry more and more about water availability, I think it's smart for the outdoor growers to say, do I need to have a risk portfolio... Risk adjusted portfolio of the way that I grow things?
Dana Worth, Plenty:
Yeah. Absolutely. And to the extent that the folks who are listening to this podcast are outdoor growers. Those are conversations that we're already having and are eager to have more of. So I'd love to include anyone who's interested in learning more.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:
Great. So one of the things that you've done in your role, which I think was a bit of a new role when you came, was building relationships with retailers and really looking at as Plenty grows and you grow your... Open the farm in Compton, and you start some other farms, just really having those different retailers that are in different parts of the country and kind of how do you work with them. So what's that been like for you? And when you walk in to talk to retailers new, do you have to explain everything or do they kind of know what's going on?
Dana Worth, Plenty:
Yeah. It's been really great. I mean, it's probably my favorite part of the job is spending time with our customers. In this case, it's retailers, you know at Impossible, I focus mostly on food service operators here at Plenty, I've been working mostly with retailers. I was lucky to be introduced as I came into our partners at Safeway Albertsons, so Plenty has a publicly announced a deal we did back in 2019 with the... Sorry, 2020, rather, with Safeway Albertsons to be partners in our California expansion, once the Compton farm is up and running.
Dana Worth, Plenty:
And so those were some relationships that were already built, but we've continued to have really productive conversations, both with retailers here in California, as well as across the country. And like I said, I enjoy it because I think that there are visionaries within all of these retailers who are thinking about the future and thinking about how to move their business to the next level.
Dana Worth, Plenty:
And connecting with those people is really gratifying because it's like you find that person who sees the world in the same way that you do. And when you have a partner like that, you can actually create a ton of value. And so I'll give an example, like when you connect with the person who also says, yes, we need to figure out what the plant-based quote unquote moment is for this industry. How do we communicate this to the retailer or to the consumer?
Dana Worth, Plenty:
Well, now you have all the tools in place, right? You have the retailer who has control over their shells. You have us as the producer who has control over how we grow and together, if we have a shared mission to communicate to the consumer. Well, wow. Now we can do a whole lot.
Dana Worth, Plenty:
So I've enjoyed building those relationships. I view as, you can probably tell, I view them as partnerships where we're... Like, we've learned a lot as Plenty in the last eight years building this company, we have obviously points of view on the future and where the industry is going. And the opportunity to share those points of views with retailers is fantastic. One of the most fun things to do is actually to bring folks up to our research facility in Laramie Wyoming. So we have...
Vonnie Estes, PMA:
In the summer, right?
Dana Worth, Plenty:
I'll go whenever they want go. I'm a east coaster originally and I miss winter sometimes. So I...
Vonnie Estes, PMA:
Well, you can get that in Laramie.
Dana Worth, Plenty:
Yeah. It was 13 degree last time I was there last week. So I enjoy... We have about just over 60 people there full-time R&D plant science about just over a dozen PhDs. And the first time I went, I joked, it was kind of like Santa's workshop. We've got bunch of different production environments where we're testing. And it's really where a lot of the... It's the core of our plant science work that happens there, obviously located there because Nate story, our co-founder did all of his graduate work at university of Wyoming.
Dana Worth, Plenty:
And we still have a really good, strong set of folks coming out of the university there. And I think when we bring retailers there, it often helps connect the dots for how... What we're doing is really technology and innovation based. And we've made this massive investment in technology that will benefit them, right? Like we've made that investment and the retailers get to reap the rewards of it and getting to tell that story is really exciting.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:
Yeah. I bet that's really cool to take people who work in produce and see the product all day to a place. I haven't been to Laramie. I've seen a lot of your research in South San Francisco, but it... That must be really enlightening to them, because it looks so different than Salina's, which is great in its own way, but this is something they haven't seen before. So that must be very fun.
Dana Worth, Plenty:
Yeah. It's getting kind of wide. I still get wide eye to them thinking about all the different knobs you can turn, all the different dials you can turn, when you have that degree of control, how much more light can you put into the system? What are cultivars that we can grow? For example, that may have been because they weren't fit for purpose outdoors. So there's all sorts of fun things you can do when you have these kinds of environments.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:
You had mentioned food service when you're talking about Impossible, are you working in food service at all with Plenty? Are you trying to supply that part of that segment?
Dana Worth, Plenty:
We are currently in retail. So the way that I think about things today is, we are currently in about 50 retailers here in Northern California that is supplied entirely out of our South San Francisco farm, which is sold out and has been for some time. That is kind of partially an R&D farm and partially a commercial farm. Really our big expansion is coming when we open the Compton facility next year down in Southern California.
Dana Worth, Plenty:
That'll be our big debut from a branding commercial standpoint. And we... I do think there's a case for the product and food service. As you mentioned, I was... Spent quite a bit of time in food service in my days at Impossible. And I think there's a case for the same reason, there's a case in retail, consumers don't care about how their product is made, they care about quality and those things are all very much things that you can communicate in a food service environment. And I think food service operators, at least certain food service operators would be very interested.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:
I think so, too. So there's been a big shift in consumer behavior over the last 12 months or so what are consumers craving in a post pandemic world and how can retailers ensure they're delivering the demand for fresher produce to consumers?
Dana Worth, Plenty:
Yeah, it's a great question. There's obviously a bit of a roller coaster and not just the initial COVID into pieces, but the subsequent supply chain challenges. One of the thing... My view is that some of these habits will stick, but people are creatures of habit, meaning a lot of what people move to will eventually revert.
Dana Worth, Plenty:
The things that I think will stick are, I do believe that the cooking at home lessons that people were forced to teach themselves, will have enduring ramifications. So whether that means more meals at home or just higher quality and ingredients in meals at home, I think that we'll see that in treating that meal more like a, not treating like a restaurant experience, but treating it more like a... Or being able to have a premium experience at home, I guess, is how I would think about it.
Dana Worth, Plenty:
And that'll obviously have positive ramifications for cart size and ring in store. I'm saying that's one I... Like I said before, I do think that for staples people will very much continue to move white goods onto recurring purchases on Amazon or elsewhere and not need to go to the store. But I think that the folks who did move over for fresh, certainly some of them will stay doing online grocery for fresh, but that there's going to be a certain amount of returning to the store.
Dana Worth, Plenty:
I mean, where you saw it, certain amount of returning to the store when it's safe to do so, just because people value that fresh experience and by the way, the brick and mortar retailers know this right and so they're innovating, as I mentioned before, they're innovating on this fresh experience to make it an attractive place to come.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:
Yeah. I've seen some when I was at CES, I think it was a couple years ago and they were showing like the grocery store, the future where everything that now is in the center of the store is upstairs. And so they'd have it upstairs and it's all managed by robots where you go in and you place the order for all those things, and then you pick all your produce and then you go to the checkout and your toilet paper and your razor blades and paper tiles are already packed. And so just have the store, be this beautiful place of flowers and produce and the rest of stuff is upstairs.
Dana Worth, Plenty:
And discovery, right? The other... When I think about the value that brick and mortar retailer has, it's twofold, it's discovery. So it's very hard to discover new things online. Meaning like, it's just you don't have the same feeling of brows, right? Of course you can, if you're really dogged and diligent, but it doesn't have quite the same experience. Although, there's a cheese that I had never bought before, but it looks interesting, right?
Dana Worth, Plenty:
That's that's experience that I have when I'm in the grocery store and then it's immediacy, right? It's okay. I need this thing today, I need it now, the second one though, is being, could potentially be eroded by some of the... Both the fast grocery delivery and the ultra fast grocery delivery that is just now expanding in the U.S. So I again, retailers, I think know this and they are really focusing on that fresh experience in store.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:
Yeah. Well, my last question, and you've talked about this a little bit, but you and I first met when you were at possible, in Impossible Foods and I was doing some work there as well. And so it's interesting. I mean, it's kind of a Silicon valley, wonder story that you've worked for these two really amazing companies that have fast growth curves and are kind of market definers. So can you talk a little bit more about what some of the parallels are? And what are some of the differences and some of the things that you've learned and in working for two companies like this?
Dana Worth, Plenty:
Yeah. It's been... I've been really lucky to work with some incredible people on some incredible ideas. For me, it comes back to the mission. The reason why I'm interested in this space in the first place is it's the... As I said, it's the place where I think you have the biggest ability to make the biggest change for the most amount of people on the planet.
Dana Worth, Plenty:
And why not focus on the system that touches the most people every single day and has the biggest delta in my belief between where we are now and where we need to be, or where we could be, within that space that creates lots of opportunities for mission based companies. And you see them not just in Impossible and Plenty, but many others [inaudible 00:33:44] company, called Clara that does egg... Fermentation based egg replacements.
Dana Worth, Plenty:
And there's 100, if not 1000 others now. And I think that's super exciting. The key though, for me, is these companies exist for the mission, right? Like we used to say it in Impossible, if we could achieve the mission, we would shut down the company tomorrow, the company doesn't exist for its own self perpetuation.
Dana Worth, Plenty:
It exists to serve a mission and the same, thing's true for Plenty, we exist to serve a mission. We have a view of what the future world should look like, and we are all in on getting there and then we can be done, right? And the reality is, of course the mission is so big that it's going to be a long time before we're done.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:
Won't be our lifetime probably.
Dana Worth, Plenty:
But when you work for a company like that, it really helps clarify decisions. It helps clarify, why we choose A over B, why we invest in a certain way, who we hire, how we make decisions at the management team level. And so that's what I'd say is shared between Impossible and Plenty, is working for a mission based company.
Dana Worth, Plenty:
And then obviously in a sector that, as I mentioned, I think has an incredible ability to impact our future. It's also, as I mentioned before, it's really exciting to work with partners, whether it's partners like dress goals or retailer partners like Safeway Albertsons who share that vision for the future and finding those people who say, yeah, I do believe that there's a different way that the future's going to look from today and it's both the... It's the struggle and the fun, right?
Dana Worth, Plenty:
And at Impossible, I... On more than one occasion was cursed at in people's kitchens. So I went... And I was in there, especially in the early days, they thought I was some crazy hippie from California with a veggie burger, trying to ruin their kitchen. And I was told to, and not nice term to get out and go the other way. But in some ways it's interesting, right? When people feel that passionately about something like, you know you're onto an important issue. And I have not been cursed at yet at Plenty, thankfully, but there...
Vonnie Estes, PMA:
Maybe greens may not be quite so controversial.
Dana Worth, Plenty:
Hey, you. But berries, people feel strongly about their berries.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:
Yeah. That's true.
Dana Worth, Plenty:
But it's an opportunity. The flip side of that is the opportunity when, as I said to partner with folks who share that vision all across the industry and the ability to see that come into fruition. And so I'm almost seven years out at Impossible. And it still makes me smile every time I walk into a Starbucks and I see the Impossible breakfast sandwich right there on the menu, right?
Dana Worth, Plenty:
That's something that we brought into the world and I believe the same is true for Plenty. Like we're going to be sitting here six, seven years from now. Maybe we can do it another podcast interview then. And think... Looking at the farms we've built and the products that are on shelf and knowing that we with our partners brought that into the world.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:
Is there any thing culturally, in addition to the mission of both companies and being very mission driven, anything about the culture of these companies or the management, or any parallels or differences there?
Dana Worth, Plenty:
Yeah. I think there's something that's really invigorating about this particular stage in the company. So we're at the stage Plenty of great. We've been investing for the better part of a decade in our technology, in our system. And we're now building this farm in Compton that'll be the largest indoor farm by output when it opens next year.
Dana Worth, Plenty:
And we're just on the verge of taking all the hard work that the engineers and the scientists have done and turning it into something, turning it into a product, turning a commercial enterprise. And that particular transition point, I went through that transition at Impossible, same thing, hundreds of millions of dollars spent on upfront technology before a single product was ever in the market. That turning point is a real kind of, in the foxhole together type, turning point where you are... You've got a small group of people.
Dana Worth, Plenty:
Usually the companies are quite, still relatively small at this stage as Plenty is, who are working really closely together to make this happen. So I certainly experienced that at Impossible. We have that here at Plenty where we've got a really good group of people who are here because they really even what we're doing. And because of that it's a great culture.
Dana Worth, Plenty:
I love this piece of it. And actually, I think one of the biggest risks to companies as they get more successful is they attract people who chase success as opposed to attract people who are interested in the process, interested in the way you get there. Everyone can identify the successes after the fact. It's more of... I admire more, I want to work more with people who love the process of getting there.

This podcast dives deep into genetics and CEA. I talk to Mohammed Oufattole, the newly named Chief Tech Oufattole at Revol Greens. Revol Greens is a CEA lettuce producer with locations in MN, CA, TX and GA. Their growth goal is to supply greens to the continental US consumer within 24 hours of harvest from one of their many locations. Mohammed has a deep background in genetics and brings experience of building new teams in R&D to Revol. He talks about the gains that can be made through breeding and why he is enthusiastic about CEA. Geek alert: This is one of my favorite topics but we keep it general enough I think all can enjoy!

Vonnie Estes, PMA:
Welcome to PMA Takes on Tech, the podcast that explores the problems, solutions, people, and ideas that are shaping the future of the produce industry. I'm your host, Vonnie Estes, Vice President of Technology for the Produce Marketing Association and I've spent years in the AG tech sector. So I can attest, it's hard to navigate this ever changing world in developing and adopting new solutions to industry problems. Thanks for joining us and for allowing us to serve as your guide to the new world of produce and technology. My goal of the podcast is to outline a problem in the produce industry and then discuss several possible solutions that can be deployed today.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:
This season of PMA Takes on Tech is brought to you by Plenty. Plenty is an indoor vertical farm that sustainably grows produce using less water and land than traditional farming and no pesticides or GMOs. The farm is able to grow peak season flavorful food year round and deliver fresh produce to its retail partners daily. Plenty's proprietary towers and intelligent platform make it the only vertical farm that can grow multiple crops with consistently superior flavors and yield.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:
Today, we dive deep into genetics and CEA. I talked to Mohammed Oufattole, the newly named Chief Technology Officer at Revol Greens. Revol Greens is a CEA lettuce producer with locations in Minnesota, California, Texas, and Georgia. Their growth goal is to supply greens to the continental US customer within 24 hours of harvest. The company is showing its commitment to breeding and technology by hiring Mo. He brings over 20 years of experience in life sciences and agricultural biotechnology research. He led a broad range of crop improvement applications and multiple R&D programs at both Benson Hill, for six years, and at Monsanto for 10 years prior. It was great to hear about his commitment to breeding and CEA. A self-proclaimed early CEA skeptic as Mo learned more about the improvements in cost structure and also the possible gains to be made through breeding he is now a CEA enthusiast. Let's join the conversation as Mo talks about his background. Tell me about your background and your current role.
Mohammed Oufattole, Revol Greens:
Yeah, absolutely. I'm a molecular biologist by training. I did a PhD in Belgium and moved to Washington State University where I did a post-doc there working on cell biology. Throughout my career, since I joined Monsanto back in 2006 and later on with Benson Hill, I really had the opportunity to work in roles that span the whole gambit of crop improvements, particularly at the genetics side, but also the interaction of the genetics with the environment. With Benson Hill the other layer that also was really fascinating is really add the components of the data and the AI application to understanding really how the genetics interacts with its environments and how the varieties... Now, how do you pick varieties for a specific environment? Because at that time we're working with field crops, and so you have to adapt your crop to the environment rather than adapt the environment to the crop.
Mohammed Oufattole, Revol Greens:
And so that was one very fascinating angle of really a... I think the improvements really that has taken place over the last few years in certain technologies, in the machine learning approaches and data analytics really stepped up the game in terms of how you look at crop improvements. So, those are the ranks that I come from. As opposed to, I guess, many in the industry of the CEA I come from a genetics rank. So I come from understanding of the variety and all that, and how other components affect it. And I do believe that there is a substantially important to that in the field.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:
So how did you get interested in CEA? I mean, that's kind of... I know both Benson Hill and Monsanto are much more row crop oriented, and so how did you kind of make that jump and what made you interested it?
Mohammed Oufattole, Revol Greens:
Yeah, I think it's a fascinating move. I got exposed deeply to the industry about maybe two, three years ago. Started working as part of the consortium called, you may be familiar with it, precision indoor plants.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:
Yes. Oh yeah. I forgot Benson Hill was part of that. Right.
Mohammed Oufattole, Revol Greens:
That is correct. It's part of the foundation for food and agriculture that's funded by Congress and it requires matching funds from the industry, so Benson Hill was part of it. So I was representing Benson Hill on the executive committee of the consortium. And in a really... The idea is that we, as the industry, come together to really think about topics that are really far fetching looking far down the road into what can be possible with the new technologies, but also develop new technologies for crop improvement. And in this case, within PIP, it's really around the indoor growing discovery and building of the knowledge. And that's really the fascinating part of about it is that you are bringing together a number of technologies from a variety of different areas from a genetic standpoint, from computer vision to the understanding of the biochemistry for when you're talking about flavor compounds and all those things. All the way to robotics and data, data analytics aspect of it.
Mohammed Oufattole, Revol Greens:
And I think that amalgamation of the different technologies just adds one interesting component to it. And I love the fact also that I'm in a... I was one of the skeptics early on about really how these could work broadly speaking beyond being just a niche of consumers, if you will. But it turned out to be that the technologies today are allowing actually the cost to come substantially from the lighting and things like that. I have a completely different view today than I had two or three years ago. And so that's how really I got interested into the space.
Mohammed Oufattole, Revol Greens:
And as I look into it a little further, I think that the attractive nature of it, it goes beyond everything I'd imagined it before. Here at Revol Greens in glass houses and on ponds we're able to... From a sustainability perspective, there's no match to it. I think we're estimating 90% less water used for [crosstalk 00:09:05]. For the same crop than you would do in the field, for example.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:
Wow.
Mohammed Oufattole, Revol Greens:
There is no other growing in agriculture conditions where you can do that. 90% less water. Not only that, but you can set this thing up anywhere. For decades, we've been hearing about how erpdoble land is shrinking, and it's becoming very problematic from that perspective, but also on the climate side of things. But-
Vonnie Estes, PMA:
Well, you're in California today, as we were talking about. I'm sure you've seen all the signs in the central valley about the water shortage and there's... You definitely see that where you are today. That we have to do this with less water.
Mohammed Oufattole, Revol Greens:
We definitely see that in here. And if I drive around and I see crops that are being irrigated with lots of water it's essentially some of it goes to the crop, a lot gets wasted. And so I think that's one of the huge, attractive aspects of the CEA. I think the other piece also is the maximization of the footprint that you're using. We're seeding, harvesting every single day of the year, year round. It's not a two season crop. It's not even a three season crop. It's every single day. So for whatever footprint you have of the land, you're using it maximally. We can grow... We have greenhouses out in Minnesota. We can grow in January where it's -30, -40. We can grow in summer. So there's no limitation to where you can grow. There is no limitation to how much you can grow or how often. And so I think it adds up to the activeness part of it.
Mohammed Oufattole, Revol Greens:
Food safety is another aspect that I think really comes to the forefront as we hear a lot about the food recalls and all that. When it comes to lettuce, for example, a lot of that is essentially irrigation, water. At least based on all indication. And because we can control everything indoor we control... When we bring in the water, it gets sterilized. There are techniques to sterilize water, so everything that comes in essentially into the pond is tested, is sterilized, it gets tested on a regular basis. We test the crop before it gets out. And so you have as much control as you can. You are limiting your risk substantially compared to what you were doing in the field.
Mohammed Oufattole, Revol Greens:
Those are really the major parts that attracted me to the field. I think that the third components, the sustainability of safety and really the ability to focus on consumer traits, this is really closer to my heart because I'm a crop geneticist and all that. One of the challenges with growing crops in the field is you want to address the challenges of the field. That means the stresses of the heat, the cold, you name it. And those are the traits in your breeding program you have to prioritize before you start thinking about flavor, taste, aroma, you name it, nutrition. And sometimes you have to make tradeoffs. You have one or the other. You can't have two or three. And in these cases, if you don't have the challenges with stresses and disease pressure and all the things you face in the field, then you don't have... Then you can actually focus on packaging the genetics that is more around the consumer. What consumer really want.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:
Let's talk about that a little bit more. I love that. What are you focusing on and what kind of tools are you using? I mean, you come with such a great background of using all different kinds of tools, tools maybe that may be a little more accepted in some of the commodity crops than they are in produce, but what are you looking at as far as consumer traits?
Mohammed Oufattole, Revol Greens:
I think the nutritional aspect of it, looking at vitamins, looking at minerals, and then there is the flavor, the taste part of it. There are by chemical pathways that you can look for varieties or genetics that has better taste, better flavor. You can bring that into the genetics. And this is something that I'm trying to map out right now working in partnership with seed companies and all that. And trying to figure out whether this is something we want to do on our own, or do it with somebody else. I think we're big on partnerships. We'd rather do it with somebody.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:
Oh, good.
Mohammed Oufattole, Revol Greens:
But I think that the industry is a little bit, right now, not really fully committed. And I've talked about seed industry to the indoor, because nobody's really breeding specifically for the indoor. Even those who say they do, they're not doing it really the right way. [crosstalk 00:15:34]
Vonnie Estes, PMA:
Ah. But do you think you'll end up having to build your own program around that? Or how are you looking at it?
Mohammed Oufattole, Revol Greens:
I'd rather not. So I think-
Vonnie Estes, PMA:
It's a lot of work and a lot of people, right?
Mohammed Oufattole, Revol Greens:
I don't think it's... I don't think it is. To be honest when you think about today with technology that exists that you can start a breeding a program from scratch and bring varieties from seed banks and everything. And within three, four years, especially in crops we're talking about, the leafy greens and all that, in three years you could get a variety out with the characteristics that you want. But again, I don't want to focus on that. I want to focus on getting the product that our consumers want first and hopefully find somebody to work with to do this. But if [crosstalk 00:16:37] don't, that is the... It's definitely on the table for us.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:
Interesting. So, I think there's probably a number of people out there that don't know about Revol Greens and what you grow and where you're located and that type of thing. So if you could just give us a background on the company, that'd be great.
Mohammed Oufattole, Revol Greens:
Oh, absolutely. Revol Greens started in 2017 on a two acres and a half out in Minnesota, just outside of Minneapolis. Some of the co-founders have been doing, working on the CEA for as far as I could... They can remember. So I think the art of growing indoor has been really perfected within the company before even the company started. And I think the one thing that attracted me to the company too is kind of the way they look at things they had. The way they are thinking about how to take the company mainstream across the US. And what I mean by that, that two acres and a half has grown into 10 in Minnesota. And there is plans to grow more into more acres over the next year or so.
Mohammed Oufattole, Revol Greens:
We've got a site now where I'm here in California, just two hours north of LA, where we are producing an operation on 16 acres. The facility has the capacity to grow up to 64. We're about to start renovating the next 16 acres essentially to get it to 32. And then just a couple of months ago we made an acquisition outside of Athens, Georgia that's already kind of servicing the Southeast and so that's a third site that's going to grow. We're thinking about the next year growing, expanding it. Right now, it's on a five acre. That's going to expand to 20 and then 40 later. Texas, we're about to start construction. We've got the plans already in place for a site. That'll start at 20 acres and grow ultimately into 100 acres over time. That's where we are going to place the R&D site. Potentially the headquarters will move into that as well.
Mohammed Oufattole, Revol Greens:
And so those are four locations spread across the country. As you can tell, there is intention to add at least a couple more sites in other places where we're not operational today, or we don't have sales. Really the goal is to be located such that you can reach every single household within 24 hours from harvest to putting it on a shelf. And that's really the mindset that really attracted me to Revol Greens. Go big. Making a healthy green and sustainable food available to every household is not a small feat.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:
No. Not at all. And I think it's interesting from a branding perspective. You use your own brand, right? You don't use store brands, you use a private-
Mohammed Oufattole, Revol Greens:
We actually... We do both. We do private label for some of our customers, but we have our own brand.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:
I think it's hard as a consumer to go in and kind of figure out the space. When I go in and I look at the store and I'm like, ""Where are these from? And who grew this?"" And so I think... And they're so regional. If you can do that local, but national, I think that's a really interesting model that you have. And what's your funding? How are you funded and where are you in that space?
Mohammed Oufattole, Revol Greens:
Yeah. We are funded primarily through Equilibrium. So they funded a lot of... Most of all our greenhouses and funded lot of the work that has been going on so far. So from that standpoint, I think we've been lucky really to have them on our side. And I think we've got a really good relationship with them. They really buy into our strategy of going big, but also being differentiated enough. One of the things that also differentiates the company is that we're not just focusing on the easy to grow kind of baby spring mix or things like that. We're tackling some of the challenges in spinach. Growing spinach, basil [crosstalk 00:22:39], kale, close to 18 different crops essentially.
Mohammed Oufattole, Revol Greens:
And so that's... It's not easy growing spinach on a hydroponic. Everybody knows how difficult that is. And we have I think the innovation mindset that is also the company has really kind of sealed the deal for me is we've got some really recipes that we're able to grow spinach with no problem. That's actually being about to be implemented right now. It's been in optimization for some time. So being a... I think that's really the differentiation also we're offering. Just a larger spread and different skews, if you will.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:
Yeah. And how do you look? I mean, your role is going to be to bring even more new products and differentiation. And so if you... You said earlier it might take a short period of time, but if you said... If you came in right now and you said, ""Okay, I'm going to develop something that has higher nutrition and better flavor,"" how long do you think it would take before you could get that to market?
Mohammed Oufattole, Revol Greens:
I think in three to four years you could get new varieties with the traits that you're looking for. Essentially what you have to do is you got to go back to your gene banks. Some of the... So my experience with Benson Hill, for example the soybean is well-known crop, right? But if you look at commodity crop, it's lost all the genes that had to do with the protein. The protein has been going down for many, many years because as yields are going up, protein is going down. And the genetics that actually drives the level of protein gets lost, so you don't find it in many of the varieties outside of Benson Hill does have some of those products. But you would find those in some germplasms in gene banks that have been put aside because they were not yielding.
Mohammed Oufattole, Revol Greens:
And so people cannot fill out, put them on the side, but the technology didn't exist at the time to delineate the protein from yield. And sometimes it's just because people didn't look the technology to measure protein in every cycle of crossing. Just it was not easy to get ahold of, or not at least not at a cost effective. And so you didn't measure the protein, you just measured yield because you see. And so over time, if you don't measure it, you don't get it you measure. So measure yield, you'd get in yield. You're present protein and a very similar thing. You can look across every crop there is a similar trend. Tomato, you go to the old varieties, they have the heirloom and things like that. That's where the flavor and taste still exists. The new varieties, they are shiny and red, beautiful, but they don't just nearly as much. The genetic is there. It's just it's not in the right germplasm today.
Mohammed Oufattole, Revol Greens:
So you can go back. You can go back, essentially bring those back and then cross them and develop. If you have genetics already, commercial genetics today, it will be a much shorter time because all you need to do is basically bring those traits from all the varieties into your commercial chassis, if you will. If you don't, that's not a deal breaker. I think you can build that genetic. And for small crops, like we talk about for the greens, you can do that in a much shorter amount of time. One of the aspects too, with these crops, these crops have not been developed to begin with, let alone for indoor grow.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:
Yeah. No, no one has spent the amount of time mapping everything out like they have corn and soy. Right?
Mohammed Oufattole, Revol Greens:
Exactly. Not a lot of money has, from a research and development standpoint, has gone into it. And so the ability to take something from scratch and move it to where you are not just competitive but at least if you focus on traits that people have not focused on before, such as consumer traits, that I think you have the opportunity to move the needle on that much faster than you would do in a soybean or corn, for example. And then if you take it to the next step where you're thinking, ""I'm going to develop it actually for a CEA environment, not for the field,"" then you can see where you can make substantial jumps there. Versus if you if you're looking at developing it for the field and having all these other consumer traits that you wanted to develop. And so that's really the beauty of it.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:
So there are those in the industry who think that genetics don't matter, and that it's all environment. So in the genetics by environment equation, that an indoor environment is everything and genetics don't matter at all. I disagree with that, and it sounds like you can kind of do too, but how do you... How far can we push... Let me ask a different way. How much do we know about the environment and how far we've pushed these crops from an environmental point of view and a lighting and a water and all the other things we can make a recipe out of before we go to genetics? Or should we do genetics first, environment second? Or how do you look at it as, as you look at that equation?
Mohammed Oufattole, Revol Greens:
I think all those things really add value. Ultimately you want all those elements to come together, but I am totally on the side of genetics has to be at the heart of it. The light, everything, the environment, the lighting, everything you want is essential, but you got to start from the genetics, because there's only so much you can push the genetics through artificial lighting and controlling the heck out of temperature and everything, and the environment around it. Nutrition and all that. But if it's not in the genetics, it's not in the genetics. That's just as simple as that.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:
You can't develop a pathway that doesn't exist by using a different light necessarily. Right?
Mohammed Oufattole, Revol Greens:
You got it. And I think the example that I provided earlier, when you take a... Which is the case today. A lot of... Almost everything that's been developed today in the space been developed for the field. What you are trying to do in the field, as a breeder, you are going to prioritize the things that are going to make your crop survive first. It's got to survive. If it tastes good and all that, it doesn't survive, it doesn't matter. Right? And so if you prioritize that, you prioritize the disease genetics and all that, what you are doing, you're compromising. You're not actually moving other things that have to do with everything that has consumer needs essentially. From a nutrition to taste and everything. So that number one.
Mohammed Oufattole, Revol Greens:
And so what people need to realize is there is a concept in breeding that's called linkage. Linkage drug. That means if I'm taking... Sometimes you may want to... You absolutely have to have this disease QTL or gene and if you have that, you have something attached to it that is either... Has to do either with not a good taste, maybe an off flavor type of compound, or dry yield, dry... It's slowing down the yield or something like that. And so if you take one, A, you're not getting B. Especially if they are very close on your chromosomes. And, so in a case where I don't have to worry about that specific disease, because it's a field disease, doesn't happen in-house or a stress, I'm going to prioritize B. I'm not getting A, but I don't want it. I don't need it. That's really I think how hopefully that paints the picture of the importance of genetics, what you can do with genetics to drive. Whether it's yield. Maximize your footprint on your system. Whether it's a pond or vertical or... And all the way to other traits that are important to consumers.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:
Well, my last question, just broadening out a little bit, so stepping back from CEA specific, you've been working in Ag tech, as have I, before it was even called Ag tech. And you were at Monsanto as we talked about Benson Hill. So just looking across your career to date, what technologies have progressed faster than you expected, and which will ones haven't? And within breeding and outside breeding as well. And what do you feel like is still missing?
Mohammed Oufattole, Revol Greens:
Yeah, I think some of the technologies that have moved really fast via the genome editing is definitely something that just five, maybe five, eight years ago you barely hear about it. And it's like one of those things that is way out there, there's no way this is going to work in a foreseeable future. And all of a sudden now you got so many companies and startups around it, and it's making tremendous progress on the healthcare side of things with some of the trials on a variety of different diseases and things like that. And in crops, it's also a technology that is likely to make significant improvement to the quality and taste of the crops. I think one of the things I just mentioned earlier on the linkage, genetic linkage, when you got a bad gene linked closer to a good one, if you do that through breeding, you're not going to be able... You're taking the whole package. You're not going to take one and leave the other. But through genome editing, you can. You can actually-
Vonnie Estes, PMA:
Do you see a place for genome editing in produce? I talk to a lot of people that are starting to look at it or retailers are afraid of it. How do you think that's going to play out in the markets that you're working in now and the use of genome editing?
Mohammed Oufattole, Revol Greens:
You know, I think that's a question that it's yet to be figured out I think. I think it's going to come down to consumer perception and all that. And at the end of the day, consumer is... The customer is king, as they say, right? But my feeling is that I think the technology in the past has been used in ways that really didn't benefit the consumer. Technologies in AG whether it's biotech or... And people didn't see the purpose of it. But the hope is that if you are now using a technology that can actually bring back the nutrition into our food and bring back the taste and flavor can that changed the minds? And honestly, that's a question to be... That's something to be seen as we go forward.
Mohammed Oufattole, Revol Greens:
But what I do know is that it's definitely going to make a significant difference in our food system if the technology is able to get past the hurdles of perception. And so we'll see. Right now I think there's a lot to be done through breeding by itself, just again, because some of these crops really still have a lot of the genetics that's sitting in shelves in gene banks that hasn't been used or put away because they didn't yield well in the field. And if you go back to it and brain you can definitely make significant changes there with, or without genome editing. But I do think that genome editing can speed up that process and get some... Some of the traits, it might be the only answer to it.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:
Yeah. What about any technologies that you thought at one point, ""Boy, this is going to really make a difference,"" and then they didn't really work out? Anything over your career like that, that you've seen?
Mohammed Oufattole, Revol Greens:
You know, I don't know that there is a technology that really didn't. I think people can argue with GMO did or didn't clearly. All I can say about that is when you look at corn and soybean, 80% to 90% is GMO in the US today. What does that tell you? [crosstalk 00:38:51] tell you, the farmer does like the technology. It works for them. It doesn't work for the consumer because they don't see the prices really coming down. You wouldn't know. If we didn't have that, maybe the prices would be astronomical today. But you wouldn't know. You don't have a control.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:
Yeah, exactly.
Mohammed Oufattole, Revol Greens:
That's one. And outside of that, as a consumer, I'm not getting any... Does it taste better now? So, because again, the focus was on the farm. Is farm productivity. It wasn't on the consumer. And so there is definitely huge successes in that space that unfortunately the perception didn't go along and that's fine. I think sometimes that's how life goes. Technologies come and go, but I don't know that there is a technology that came and completely failed. I think every single thing, every time you... There's a stepping stone at everything. What is really, really cool now is the ability to put all that thing together and from a data aspect to genetics, to physiology, to computer vision. And bringing that together in a way that you can analyze it live, you can look at it back over time, or even prediction in the future around your harvest, around your timing of the year. Things like that is just, it's just really fascinating.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:
Yeah. There's just so many tools that we can use now that are pretty amazing and how they're going together. And I think sometimes it's like a circle. When I look at some of the technologies I've worked on, I worked in bio controls the early part of my career, and they didn't work very well. I can see why people didn't adopt them because they didn't work very well. But now for lots of reasons we have better ways of testing them. We have better ways applying them through precision application. So now it's... I think it's bio controls time and I think some of the technologies, that's just kind of how they go. It's to a circle and you have to develop other things around it. So it'll be interesting.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:
I think with genome editing we're... Consumers have competing interests. We have to adapt to climate change. We have to. We have to use less water. We have to have less food waste. There's a lot of consumer interests that compete with, ""I don't want to use that technology."" And so I think you'll be in a good position. We'll have to talk in five years to see what you decided for your company makes sense. Because you have all competing interests of consumers and genome editing might be the way best way to solve that. And consumers may embrace that. We'll just have to see where that goes. Right?
Mohammed Oufattole, Revol Greens:
Yep. Yep.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:
Yeah. Well, thank you very much for your time. This has been a great conversation and I look forward to watching your career and what you do and make an impact on CEA. So, thank you.

Vonnie Estes, PMA:
Welcome to PMA Takes On Tech. The podcast that explores the problems, solutions, people, and ideas that are shaping the future of the produce industry. I'm your host, Vonnie Estes, Vice President of Technology for the Produce Marketing Association. And I've spent years in the AgTech sector. So I can attest, it's hard to navigate this ever changing world in developing and adopting new solutions to industry problems.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:
Thanks for joining us and for allowing us to serve as your guide to the new world of produce and technology. My goal of the podcast, is to outline a problem in the produce industry and then discuss several possible solutions, that can be deployed today. This season of PMA Takes On Tech ,is brought to you by Plenty.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:
Plenty is an indoor vertical farm that sustainably grows produce using less water and land, than traditional farming and no pesticides or GMOs. The farm is able to grow peak season, flavorful food year round and deliver fresh produce to its retail partners daily. Plenty's proprietary towers and intelligent platform, make it the only vertical farm that can grow multiple crops, with consistently superior flavors and yield.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:
On today's podcast, we have two professionals from Wells Fargo to discuss this season's topic CEA. Why Wells Fargo, you ask? According to top 100 farm lenders, Wells Fargo has been the nation's leading agricultural lender among commercial banks, for 25 consecutive years. They bring farm to fork expertise to clients in the agribusiness, food and beverage industries.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:
They provide strategic products designed to mitigate industry specific risk and provide a full suite of services for businesses of all sizes. I talked to Matt Servatius, Market Executive for the Central region and Karol Flynn, Sector Analyst within food and agribusiness. They give their perspectives as a bank on financing, technology and where the industry is headed.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:
As we've heard in other episodes, indoor Ag is a new industry with an underdeveloped ecosystem. Institutions like Wells Fargo, will play a role in the build out and scale up of a successful industry. Let's listen to Matt and Karol. Karol and Matt, welcome to the podcast. Please introduce yourself a little of your background and your role at Wells Fargo. Karol, why don't we start with you.
Karol Aure-Flynn, Wells Fargo:
Great. Thank you so much, Vonnie for having us. I'm a member of the food and agribusiness industry advisors at Wells Fargo. We're sort of this special sauce behind Wells Fargo's commitment to the Food and Ag space. Our role is to provide industry insights about leadership and also really evaluate risk at both the market level and at customer and prospect level, for all the different sectors of agriculture.
Karol Aure-Flynn, Wells Fargo:
We're part of the agribusiness food and hospitality division, but we really serve the entire bank. And I'm very proud to be part of that group. We cover from dairy, to food products, protein, sugar, all of the different sectors, produce of course. So thank you for having us.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:
Sure. And Matt?
Matt Servatius, Wells Fargo:
Yes. Hey Vonnie. Thanks for having us. Matt Servatius. So gosh, I've been with Wells Fargo for almost 18 years now. I'm based in Denver, Colorado. and I sit in our tech banking group. So I have responsibilities for our tech lending effort for the 20 states in the middle of the country. And then I have national responsibilities for our sustainable tech effort, which has me covering a lot of the Food and AgTech companies.
Matt Servatius, Wells Fargo:
So we work with venture backed companies, up through kind of a large mid corporate profile business. So really span the whole life cycle of these businesses that are going through big growth curves. And so Karol and I partner very closely with respect to where tech and food and Ag are coming together. So great to be with you today.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:
Yeah, I think it was really interesting to me to learn. I mean, I bank with Wells Fargo. And so when I think of Wells Fargo, I think of my checking account. So it's really interesting to hear how much you guys are involved in this industry. And you both have really strong backgrounds, to understand the industry and really help your customers in this space. So I'm excited to shine some light on some of your thoughts on the Controlled Environment Ag.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:
So let's start out with, since you are a financial institution, let's talk about some of the financial aspects of CEA. So how do these companies make money, if they are making money? And knowing that there're a number of different types of companies that are kind of under the CEA umbrella.
Matt Servatius, Wells Fargo:
I will jump in. What I would say is, most of them are not making money. At least those that we've come across. And I think the biggest driver of that is, so many of them have not scaled up yet. They're really still in that build out stage. I mean, you have some of these longstanding greenhouse players, that have been around for a decade or plus and some of those folks are profitable. Leveraging existing technology that's been developed over in Europe and utilized for years.
Matt Servatius, Wells Fargo:
But the ones you read about, really in the Controlled Environmental Ag space, they're really not making money yet. And it really does come down to scale. So it'll be interesting to see with time, how these companies navigate growth and the capital requirements to get the scale necessary and how they go about financing those. But most that we come across right now, are still burning significant amounts of cash.
Karol Aure-Flynn, Wells Fargo:
And Matt, I really want to echo that. I think it's a super exciting time as we look at this space and as far as their maturity. But at this point, we're observing a maturing industry. It's very capital intensive at this time. And when we see the revenue streams, it's really exciting to see the victories, but they're not at the traditionally bankable level as of yet.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:
So what are some of the issues that are keeping them from making money? You say scale is one, so they're just not getting big enough. But what are some of the other things that are going on, that's kind of keeping these ... I think focusing mostly here the conversation, we're talking about more the vertical farms and the kind of highly finance farms I think. What you said before, the indoor tomato greenhouse space is a more mature market and they're doing pretty well. But if we kind of focus here for a minute, just on the indoor vertical farms, what's keeping them from making money?
Matt Servatius, Wells Fargo:
I think part of it is, I think a big part is the financing, at the local indoor farm level. And I think part of that is, because traditional banks like Wells Fargo are looking for cash flow, these companies are in a startup phase. And so we have to risk rate based off of a cash burning business. And I think a linchpin to getting these things to be more fanciable, would be true off-take contractual relationships. Right? With the Kroger, with a Walmart. Right? Where they're going to take or pay what is delivered to them, under kind of a produce purchase agreement, something that is contractual.
Matt Servatius, Wells Fargo:
If the industry can start moving in that direction and companies can get away with those contractual relationships, all of a sudden you're going to open up debt financing at the farm level, which is an inhibitor to these businesses to scale up. Right? There's only so much equity capital that can go into these businesses before they need debt. Right, to really bring down that weighted average cost of capital. So BrightFarms is one that pioneered that early on. And I think more proliferation of that, will help these businesses become profitable faster.
Karol Aure-Flynn, Wells Fargo:
And that's an interesting point, because before you have scale, it's difficult to meet those contracts and to win at those contracts. This is a very competitive industry. As we all know, the traditional players have already hit a level of maturity and concentration, where they have very strong contracts that might be difficult to penetrate. So I fully expect we'll have some conversation as this goes on, about partnerships.
Karol Aure-Flynn, Wells Fargo:
But fascinating business model to try to disrupt a very mature and well run, sophisticated, fresh produce complex, even you can think of it globally, but if you want to look just even at the US on its own and very nimble. So the Controlled Environment folks, even just looking at the vertical and indoor, they have a lot of competition that they have to address from the traditional side. So I think that's an important thing to think about.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:
Yeah. I think years ago, many years ago, like 10 years ago, I was working on a project of doing some indoor strawberries in a traditional greenhouse. And we talked to a couple of the retailers in the area, this was New Mexico and Texas. And they said, ""We're not going to commit to buy anything from you, because if we do that, we have to tell our other suppliers that we're not going to buy from them."" And we were only going to supply for just the winter months. And so they said, ""We can't do that.""
Vonnie Estes, PMA:
So I think you've got a lot of these traditional relationships that you're trying to break into. But I think going forward with some of these crops, starting with leafy greens and then moving into other crops, these in indoor Ag companies, should be able to do good take or pays because they can guarantee supply throughout the year, that's going to be very consistent. They're not going to get hit by a hail storm. They're not going to have a lot of the issues that outdoor has.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:
So it'll be interesting to see as the market matures, if those take or pay contracts end up being the norm. So you mentioned a little bit about debt financing and in some of the financing models. And so what financing models do you think are working in the industry? You mentioned BrightFarms and which ones are not? Is the VC investment with high valuations the right way to go? Or are there other models that even some of these big guys should start looking at?
Matt Servatius, Wells Fargo:
I think the equity financing, right, is the right model for now to start. But I think the type of investor is really important. I think the traditional Venture Capitalist here is, not going to be as active as the investors you see that are active. Right? It's the larger sovereign funds, it's family offices, it's corporate venture arms, that are looking at it beyond just the financial return of that investment. But for other reasons that the patient investor, I think, is going to be really critical.
Matt Servatius, Wells Fargo:
And you see those players being in my view, the most active. One, because they can write big checks. Because they don't have that same investment horizon that traditional VCs do. You do see some of the pure play VCs around this, but I come from the Clean Tech background and a lot of that venture community, got blown out because they underappreciated the capital requirements required in the solar system back in 2010 through 2014. So equity financing is the right play. It's making sure you have the right investor lineup, that understands the long game here versus the short-term return.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:
Yeah. I think I was with you in the whole Clean Tech roller coaster ride. And one of the things that we saw there, was the need for really capital intense businesses and the need to really ... A lot of the projects I work on, they really needed project financing and it wasn't available because it was too early, but it was too late for VC. And so how do you see project financing might play a role in this, once things are a little more proven out?
Matt Servatius, Wells Fargo:
Right. Yeah, exactly. And part of the financing that was available, was government financing. Right? DOE loan guarantees that took, to say a long time would be an understatement. A long time to get that capital. And we don't do a lot of USDA loan guarantees to my knowledge. But if those mechanisms were more readily available, I think that could really help things out here.
Matt Servatius, Wells Fargo:
I think it's a net positive, that these companies are not reliant upon subsidies as we found in solar and wind. Right? You don't get that whipsaw effect. Is that investment tax credit going to be renewed, or extended? Things of that sort. So government financing programs, if they could be more readily available and more rapidly deployable, I think that could be a real net positive here.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:
One of the things I've seen in other industries as well is, sometimes the first generation of these companies, aren't the ones that then go on and be successful. It's kind of the generation that comes after them. And not that you have a crystal ball anymore than anyone else does, but just what's your sense on, do you think these first large, first of a kind companies, are going to be the ones that are going to take this technology into the future? Or do you think it's going to be the second generation that comes behind them with new technologies?
Karol Aure-Flynn, Wells Fargo:
I probably can start with that. I'm not sure that these are first generations. Some of the first generations might be the big greenhouse and efforts of previous traditional corporate players, that started something and closed it, because of either some operational situation they found was more challenging.
Karol Aure-Flynn, Wells Fargo:
Proven out is what I heard you say in the previous commentary. And I think that we're learning as we're going, I don't know what the timeframe is, but I think it's going to be quicker than we think. That they're going to learn about how to set controls in these buildings, how to work with lighting, how to manage labor. I think this is a different type of labor force.
Karol Aure-Flynn, Wells Fargo:
There's oftentimes the same heading, that a traditional player might work with, with their operational risks, but they're discovering in high, fast forward motion. And I think that the current players learn from those past experiences and again, partners matter.
Matt Servatius, Wells Fargo:
Yeah. I agree with that. And I think you're going to ... It's somewhat fragmented right now and regionalized, but I think you're going to see more consolidators too, right, to help drive that scale. It's like I'm doing PR for BrightFarms. I'm not intending to, but Cox just acquired them outright, right? They led in equity financing for them. And there's others where I think you're going to see more consolidation with some of these bigger players, that will help drive scale, will help drive access to financing as well. And so I do think some of these early drivers of these technologies and platforms, are going to get consolidated, maybe at a state level, Western region level, et cetera.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:
So moving on, just thinking about the effect that this will have. How do you think, or how are you hearing that outdoor growers are responding to indoor Ag? Do they see it as a threat, or do they see it as part of the whole industry? Or what are you hearing from some of your customers that grow outside?
Karol Aure-Flynn, Wells Fargo:
We're hearing ... I mean, customers are always going to look at what's supposed to be disruptive, as almost competitive in nature and that always drives innovation. I'm seeing more and more partnership. I think there's a lot of discussion going on in the back of maybe what we see. And there's going to be, the winners are going to find new ways to win. Certainly, the current industry, the CEA industry, is driving innovation faster than we would've done without it. So I really believe it's going to be positive all around for the industry.
Matt Servatius, Wells Fargo:
Yeah. It seems very complimentary to me. Right? I mean, CEA is not going to replace outdoor growing with the amount of mouths we have to feed. Right?
Vonnie Estes, PMA:
Definitely.
Matt Servatius, Wells Fargo:
And it does seem like a part of this solution. And you're seeing these players Driscoll's and others, coming in to equity rounds with the Plenty or others, right, to get under the foot a little bit. And those ... Driscoll's, name the big specialty produce company, could ultimately be natural acquirers of these business. I just think it's a part of the equation, I don't think it's the only equation.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:
Yeah. I think they run the entire supply chain and they know how this all works. And so I think they're looking at the industry and thinking about how should I be involved? I was at the Western Growers' Annual Meeting recently and Bruce Taylor was talking about vertical farms and kind of people are asking him, ""What do you think?"" And they made an acquisition.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:
And the story that he tells since he told this publicly, I think I can tell it publicly, but was he said that he went to visit ARO Farms very early on. And he said, ""I walked in there and there were nine Cornell PhDs working at ARO Farms."" And I thought to myself, ""Do I have nine PhDs working for me?"" And so he thought, ""I can't build this myself, but I see that this is an important industry to be in."" And so they made an acquisition into it.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:
And so I think a number of companies are thinking about that. Sticking their toe in and thinking, ""We've got, especially here in California, we're going to have problems with water. It's going to have an effect on production here. And so, how do you just de-risk by growing someplace else, or not using as much water in a situation of growing inside."" So, I think there's a lot of... It'll be interesting to see how that all plays out with the outdoor growers.
Karol Aure-Flynn, Wells Fargo:
I have another additional thing to add there. I really believe the traditional Ag has some nimbleness, that perhaps the indoor and capital intensive structure doesn't have. So I don't believe one is going to replace the other. So when we see a very expensive field of leafy greens being cultivated, plowed under because the market changed, that's a nimbleness, even though it looks very profound. It's a nimbleness that may not be available if you've contracted under lights and in a structure. So I think there's going to be room for both. And nimbleness doesn't just mean the newer model.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:
That's a really good point. I hadn't thought of that. Because there're things that you have the ability to do when you're growing outside, that you don't when you have structure that you're paying all these costs, whether you're growing something or not.
Karol Aure-Flynn, Wells Fargo:
Right. And market risk is one of the things we really look at. And so we'll see how this plays out.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:
Yeah. So everybody's favorite topic these days, is supply chain. It's the fault of everything. So what are you hearing about supply chain issues and how is this impacting indoor Ag positive or negative? They have a leg up on that, or is it more of an issue for them?
Karol Aure-Flynn, Wells Fargo:
I'm not sure we're at the scale where we can really see it. Of course, we can expect that transportation, when you're closer to the end user, transportation might be slightly improved. Some pricing might be slightly improved. But some of the supply chain is about, like you mentioned earlier, or you mentioned on your questions, which was about packaging. Both sides are going to be impacted by that. By the cost of resin, or the availability of pre-made packaging. I'm not sure we see a clear winner on that one either. And the scale isn't there for us to really know. Maybe three years from now, we'll have a better feel for that.
Matt Servatius, Wells Fargo:
Right. And anecdotally, I think that's right. Anecdotally, one would think that they'd be insulated perhaps a little bit more, because the inputs are far less, right, to grow and yield at some amount of crop. But certainly they're falling victim to the shortage of skilled labor as well. Right? I think every sector has been impacted that dramatically through this pandemic.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:
Yeah, yeah. I think the one advantage is going to be if you're closer to your market. So that's the one advantage of indoor, I think. But like you said, all the other shortages are going to hit them as well.
Matt Servatius, Wells Fargo:
Right. But perhaps, then thinking about what else do they need? Well, they need warehousing space to grow. Right? And they want to be in the metros close to the urban areas. So presumably, I don't have anything empirical to point to, but presumably, there's going to be space in those metros available, right, as we're all working from home and in more hybrid environments. That there could be a net positive, in terms of securing space at least rates that are more attractive, than they would've been three or four years ago.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:
Very cool. So Karol, you touched on this a little bit, but do you think that technology that we've learned from indoor Ag, will translate to the field? Do you see different technology, just learnings and understanding how to grow and that sort of thing. Do you think that will translate to the field?
Karol Aure-Flynn, Wells Fargo:
I absolutely do. I think actually the learnings are happening both ways, especially as these partnerships that we mentioned earlier, between the traditional and the new start to share. Bruce Taylor may tip his hat to eight Cornell PhDs, but those eight Cornell PhDs were probably telling the same story back at their dinner table, that they met Bruce Taylor.
Karol Aure-Flynn, Wells Fargo:
So because of his experience and because of access to the experience on his staff and he's been hiring very smart people for a very long time, that have a different skillset. But I think about automation and breeding, water usage, the fertility issues around these really highly specialized crops and lighting of course. But yeah, I think it's going to go both ways. Absolutely.
Karol Aure-Flynn, Wells Fargo:
And they're starting to share some of the same innovators that have been key players in the traditional space, are consulting with the new innovators, both ways. It's been fascinating from an industry perspective.
Matt Servatius, Wells Fargo:
And taking the contrarian view, it would almost seem because of the variables that are out of the outdoor growers control, that you have to be more innovative in the outdoor field, than you do in the indoor to a certain degree. Right?
Karol Aure-Flynn, Wells Fargo:
Well, when there is some kind of past outbreak in an indoor facility, I think some really smart entomologists that have seen it all before, might be the right one to bring into the picture. So I mean, I'm always thinking of it from the field perspective and from historical perspective. As a farmer, I want the best people at the table, no matter what.
Matt Servatius, Wells Fargo:
No doubt.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:
Yeah. So why are big AgTech companies paying attention to this space? What are their interests?
Matt Servatius, Wells Fargo:
I think their interests follows the money need. Right? And I think consumers more and more, are demanding better tasting produce. I think they're looking for produce that can be delivered nearly same day. Right? I think we're not far away from that. And I think the grocers are looking at this because it's generally, I think, higher margin for them, which leads to more ancillary sale. When you're buying that special herbs that some indoor grower grow and you're going to have a nice meal with a nice bottle of wine that you buy in that same grocer. So I think the bigger AgTech companies see the dollar signs around it and the consumer is driving that, is at least what I'm seeing and hearing.
Karol Aure-Flynn, Wells Fargo:
I think the big AgTech companies, are paying attention just as you say, Matt, to the consumers. Consumers are really fickle. They say one thing and they do something else with their behavior. And so if an AgTech company's end user is in a traditional player, or an innovator, they still are driven by the consumer. So the more those AgTech companies can see what's happening with that end product, it's going to elevate their opportunity to grow their own, develop their own AgTech strategy, or to develop their marketing strategy.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:
What's the impact of food inflation?
Karol Aure-Flynn, Wells Fargo:
Food inflation is the $60 million question. Maybe it's billions of dollars probably, adds some zeros to that. I think the important thing here, is to recognize that you have to segment it. Overall food inflation might be four to eight percent and it might be pushing even higher than eight percent. But you look at the segments that are growing, dairy prices have not increased at all. In fact, they're falling.
Karol Aure-Flynn, Wells Fargo:
The fats, the meats, have been going up around the 10% mark. If you look at what part of food inflation does the fresh produce, or the products that are grown in these special indoor environments take, what will the market bear? A two to five increase in produce sales? It certainly looks like it from the retail numbers that we see from Nielsen.
Karol Aure-Flynn, Wells Fargo:
I don't have a view on the food service as much. I suspect the market will bear more there. Will food inflation allow and give an opportunity to innovators to charge more? Perhaps. Is it shifting the sort of an American tolerance for higher prices? Maybe. I think we have to ... Details matter.
Karol Aure-Flynn, Wells Fargo:
And food inflation, there's an element of being driven by port congestion and supply chain, but we might be just in the middle of a greater shift for higher prices. That's probably positive for the indoor Ag folks.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:
Yeah. Matt, anything to add that? Nope.
Matt Servatius, Wells Fargo:
She captured it.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:
Yep. So why does packaging matter?
Karol Aure-Flynn, Wells Fargo:
I'm also going to try on that one. I think packaging matters because consumers are being purposeful with what they ... For a number of reasons on packaging. It's they want packaging that's environmentally sustainable. They want packaging that helps them have a sense of comfort with food safety. But packaging matters because it costs money. And it costs money, not just in creating and just not the price per package, but how does it transport? How does it work? What's its function?
Karol Aure-Flynn, Wells Fargo:
So we're looking at all of those things. And I think both tradition, I mean, it's been a incredible evolution of the retail space and food service space, in packaging of these types of products that are grown. But we're going to really have to watch cost and watch how consumers see the environmental impact of packaging.
Matt Servatius, Wells Fargo:
Well, and I know this has been talked over the years. Is there a new standard around produce that's in the Controlled Environmental Ag environment, with no pesticides and 90% less water? And is there a standard, complimentary, or above organic, right, the consumers start looking for? I know early days folks in the CEA industry, were exploring that. I don't know how much traction that's gotten, if any at all. But yeah, it matters. Right? And we all know the ESG tailwinds are more important than ever right now to a lot of consumers. And so packaging and the brand that people are sourcing from, becomes that much more important.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:
To finish up, thank you guys so much for being on. And I have one last question for you. And Karol, let's start with you. How do you think the CEA industry's going to look in five to 10 years from now? Where do you see the growth? What's it going to look like?
Karol Aure-Flynn, Wells Fargo:
I think as I've talked about throughout this discussion, I think we're going to see some really interesting partnerships, much more mature industry. I think the consumer is going to perhaps recognize the difference between indoor and traditionally grown products, but branding is going to mean more than ever.
Karol Aure-Flynn, Wells Fargo:
Consumers really want to know who stands behind these products, will continue to serve nutritious and beautiful produce across the U.S. and around the world. So very excited about the next steps.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:
Great. Matt, how about you? What's the industry going to look like?
Matt Servatius, Wells Fargo:
Yeah, I think you're going to see a lot more consolidation. I think the partnerships will be key. I think you're going to see Real Estate Investment Trusts, REITs, looking to make investments here in a much bigger way. When they can lock down a sticky tenant, whose got a 10 year lease, to where they'll actually invest, right, in some of those tenant improvements to lock in that tenant occupying a million square feet to grow produce. So partnerships are going to be big, but I think you're going to start to see a lot of these CEA players become divisions of the biggest food and Ag companies globally.

Vonnie Estes, PMA:Welcome to PMA Takes on Tech, the podcast that explores the problems, solutions, people, and ideas that are shaping the future of the produce industry. I'm your host, Vonnie Estes, vice president of technology for the Produce Marketing Association. And I've spent years in the ag tech sector. So I can attest, it's hard to navigate this ever changing world in developing and adopting new solutions to industry problems. Thanks for joining us and for allowing us to serve as your guide to the new world of produce and technology. My goal of the podcast is to outline a problem in produce industry and then discuss several possible solutions that can be deployed today.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:This season of PMA Takes on Tech is brought to you by Plenty. Plenty is an indoor vertical farm that sustainably grows produce using less water and land than traditional farming and no pesticides or GMOs. The farm is able to grow peak season, flavorful food year round, and deliver fresh produce to its retail partners daily. Plenty's proprietary towers and intelligent platform make it the only vertical farm that can grow multiple crops with consistently superior flavors and yield.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:Hello, we have a great episode for you all on AeroFarms. Roger Buelow, CTO and Stacy Kimmel, VP of R&D dig deep into the origin story of AeroFarms and its culture. They talk about the company's beginning at a kitchen table at a nightclub in New Jersey to building the largest R&D indoor vertical farm in UAE and the new farm expansion to Virginia. We talk a lot about the partnerships and collaborations AeroFarms is in that allows for the company to move more quickly using the knowledge and technology of their partners. Let's jump into the conversation with Roger and Stacy. So welcome, Roger and Stacy. I'm so glad to have you guys here and excited to hear about AeroFarms. So why don't we start with you Stacy and just give us a little bit of your background and your role at AeroFarms.
Dr. Stacy Kimmel, AeroFarms:Sure. Thanks, and I'm really happy to be here as well. A little bit about me, I am a food scientist by education, which is a little bit unusual in a farming company, but I have been working in the food industry for 23 years, leading product development, technology innovation for Fortune 500 CPG companies. All food companies have agriculture related aspects to them. So while I wasn't working in farming per se, we were procuring and working very directly with agriculture ingredients. So there is a strong connection there. Certainly, also around the commercialization aspects of what I do, which I'll cover in a bit. But I worked for the Campbell Soup Company and McCormick & Company before coming to AeroFarms. I've been in AeroFarms for about two years now. So at AeroFarms, I lead a team of plant scientists, molecular biologists, growers, data scientists, and research assistants.
Dr. Stacy Kimmel, AeroFarms:So my role really encompasses three areas. I like to think about it that way. Commercialization of new products and improving leafy greens so that we're bringing better value to our consumers and our company as we build new farms. We also spend time on new technologies and new categories beyond leafy greens and we'll get into that a little bit with partnerships. That tends to be where the partnerships come in. A lot of times is around items other than leafy greens. Also, as a leader of an R&D team, it's my responsibility, I believe to strengthen our capabilities as an R&D organization. So I'm responsible for developing my team professionally and bringing to them the latest technology in our facilities, both in Newark and in the UAE, which we'll cover in a little bit as well. There's a lot of exciting things happening there.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:So how many people do you have on your team in R&D?
Dr. Stacy Kimmel, AeroFarms:I have 18 people.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:Great. Fabulous. Well, I think that's a really interesting background and bringing the whole food space into growing the types of products that you guys are producing. It makes a lot of sense. Roger, why don't we move into your background and your role, and then we can start talking and maybe you can start talking a little bit about AeroFarms' overview and history as well. It'd be great to hear all that.
Roger Buelow, AeroFarms:Sure. That'd be great. Yeah. When I start talking about my career, we'll start with talking about high efficiency lights and then pretty much the second act of my career has been in and around AeroFarms. So it'll be natural to weave in some of the history of AeroFarms when we get to that point. So like I said, my career has been one centered around high efficiency. And I grew up in the auto industry in Detroit and then worked at GE Lighting and made the most efficient lights there. That turned into an opportunity to go into the startup world with a company that was eventually called Energy Focus, where I served as the CTO and made very high efficiency lights for commercial buildings, made the most efficient lights for the U.S. Military, and then also the most efficient solar cells for the U.S. Military.
Roger Buelow, AeroFarms:So it was been a career where we'd bring together 10 to 20 scientists or engineers to really push the limits, break the records of high efficiency lights, high efficiency solar, and now I get to work on what's the most efficient way to grow high flavor plants and highly nutritious plants? So at the same time, I was supplying the U.S. Navy with lights out the front door. I like to say I was helping out AeroFarms out the back door. So we had an investor that invested both in Energy Focus and in AeroFarms, that investor brought me and Ed Harwood, one of our founders together in 2009 and that's when I started helping out AeroFarms. So sometimes that meant driving to Ithaca, New York to help Ed out in person. A lot of times it meant pushing LED lights out the back door to help improve the overall efficiency of AeroFarms growing systems.
Roger Buelow, AeroFarms:At that time, AeroFarms was selling farms. So now let's weave in how this matches up with AeroFarms' history. AeroFarms started with Ed Harwood was part of it. Started a company called AeroFarms where he was finding a way to grow aeroponically different than hydroponically. Dr. Harwood had been the CEO of dairy equipment companies, and at the time, he was working in extensions services out of Cornell. He saw people growing hydroponically and thought that maybe there's a better way. So he started to live the American inventor story where you're on your kitchen table and you're figuring out different ways to make an aeroponic mist. And now, you're taking over your whole dining room and then he took over his garage.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:This was in 2010 or so, or when was this?
Roger Buelow, AeroFarms:This would be 2004, 2005.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:Oh, wow. So really early. No one was even thinking about this stuff. That's [crosstalk 00:08:13].
Roger Buelow, AeroFarms:Oh yeah. Ed was definitely trailblazer. Somewhere around 2009, Ed and I met up. At that point, he had a facility outside of his house and sometimes he had some employees that were working with him. Sometimes it was just him. On one day, it was just him, but he was trapped under the machine and he just was waiting for his wife to realize that he hadn’t home so she would come and rescue him. But there's the American inventor story. It is a lot of creativity and a lot of finding what's the right application and what's the right answer to a whole new field. And at that time, what Ed was focused on was creating the aeroponic mist in different ways to deliver the nutrient solutions.
Roger Buelow, AeroFarms:And in 2009, on the day that we met, we worked out on a literal napkin, the efficiency of LEDs and how by 2017, the world could be our oyster if we marched along a particular efficiency curve. We did between 2009, 2017. We did march on that curve and that helped us to start shipping to all the places we ship today. But that's jumping too far ahead. I have to go back to 2009, because at around that time, our other two co-founders, Marc Oshima and David Rosenberg, they had a company called Just Greens and their company and Ed's company merged together to become Just Greens, doing business as AeroFarms, since we switched back and forth between which brand were using different times. But most people know us as AeroFarms. David and Marc brought a view of going large with AeroFarms.
Roger Buelow, AeroFarms:So instead of selling the farms like Ed had been doing up until that point, their point was, ""Well, let's sell the produce."" And part of the reason was that we needed to control our own destiny from an operations point of view, because we were still inventing how these systems go together, we were still inventing how the... What kind of data we wanted to collect and working out what really worked the best in terms of our different algorithms. I joined up as an employee in 2014. So I was... Things had gone far enough with AeroFarms. I had done as much as I could as a friend and then as an advisor and signed up to help go to the next level. There was about eight of us at that time and we were operating out of a converted nightclub really in Newark.
Roger Buelow, AeroFarms:So eight of us sat on the mezzanine of the nightclub and we looked down as we were onto the floor of the nightclub, where we were building up the next generation of the farms. And at that point right now, instead of the American inventor story, we were living the venture backed company story. So that meant every year, year and a half, siding what risk we wanted to reduce and putting together a plan and a focused effort to handle that, raising money to achieve that, and if we had reduced the risk and if we had moved the company forward, a plan to raise the next round. And that's worked really well for us. So at that converted nightclub, we doubled our yields and that was enough for us to be able to reduce a certain amount of risk and open up a pilot facility.
Roger Buelow, AeroFarms:And at that pilot facility then, we boosted our yields again, and we showed that we could hit all of our food safety metrics and third-party certifications. We showed that people were willing to pay the price that we expected for our product, and we showed that we could hit the yields using a staff of farm workers that we are training up in a way that could be repeatable going forward. We raised another round of money and we set up our first production facility still in Newark, New Jersey. If you see videos of AeroFarms online, that's where you're looking. You're peeking into. You're taking a look at our facility at 212 Rome Street and seeing how we are producing baby leafy greens and microgreens every day of the week and in a system that is... It's the third generation along of our grow towers, but a lot of those videos that you see are four or five years old, and we've progressed quite a bit since then as we're heading into the future.
Roger Buelow, AeroFarms:So I'll point out, since those days in the nightclub, our efficiency's gone up by about a factor of six to eight in terms of yields and energy inputs. I think eight probably is a fair number and we're not done. So we're still today, still concentrating on how we can do things more efficiently, still today, we're concentrating on how we can make our plants happier and healthier and marching along really in a path that Ed Harwood set out in 2004. And I'm proud to be able to continue on with some of the legacy that Ed had laid out for us.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:Great. Thank you. That is such a great origin story. I heard a story that Bruce Taylor of Taylor Farms told just a couple of days ago, he was talking about the first time he visited AeroFarms was in that nightclub, and he said, ""I go into this place and the disco ball is still up."" So it's a really great story.
Dr. Stacy Kimmel, AeroFarms:On one of our buildings, we still have... It's primarily our research facility, but we still have a lot of the original paint and decoration from paintball court. So there's all this crazy graffiti-looking stuff all over the wall, and I was talking to my team a few weeks ago and we're putting in a... Upgrading a space there to be a little bit more like a laboratory space so that we can do some different types of bench work there. And I said, well, ""Do you want to paint the room?"" And they said, ""Well, I don't know. There's good mojo here with this. So I don't know if we should paint the room."" And I said, ""Well, got it and we can just decide if we want to paint the room."" But there is something to some of the aspects of where we work that I think people are...
Dr. Stacy Kimmel, AeroFarms:They really feel close to the company, I think because of its roots and the buildings that we work in, they share, just by walking into them, that history. All you have to do is look around and you can see a little bit about what Roger was talking about without even ever hearing the story. So we'll see if we paint. I'll keep you posted.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:Yes. Keep me posted on that. Stacy, let's continue with you on just looking at R&D capabilities.
Dr. Stacy Kimmel, AeroFarms:Sure.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:What I hear about AeroFarms so much is just how much R&D that you're doing and your facilities and what you're working on. So why don't you talk to us a little bit about that?
Dr. Stacy Kimmel, AeroFarms:Yeah, yeah. Sure. So, I mean, we essentially have in Newark, a fully-controlled smart farm. Within our grow towers, we use aeroponic technology. I think Roger alluded to that. This is really where the name AeroFarms comes from. That technology allows us to mist the roots of the plant with fully oxygen, water, and nutrients, and we also have an automated delivery system that we have developed and programmed specifically in-house for our growing system. So that allows us to very tightly control and manipulate nutrients that our plants are receiving in the farm. We also have genetics of the plants that are tailored for growing in our environment and as Roger mentioned, lighting is a really, really important part of what we do. It's a cost and we're constantly improving our LED lighting and all of our lighting is proprietary for AeroFarms.
Dr. Stacy Kimmel, AeroFarms:So nobody has it, and we're advancing that technology all the time. So my team is working a lot in the lighting space, trying to understand what spectrums of light we want to use to increase nutrition, advance some of the flavor characteristics that are interesting to us, and we're looking at lighting not just in leafy greens, but some other areas that we've been working in like berries and some of the breeding aspects that you'll hear about relative to our partnerships. So that's pretty exciting to take that information that we're learning in leafy greens and translate it over into other crops. So we grow on a cloth media. I listened to your talk with Nate the other day and it's a bit of a different system. So we grow on a flat cloth media. It is reusable and made from recycled material. It does interact with the plant in a very special way. We've tried so many different growth media. That's also very critical to what we're doing.
Dr. Stacy Kimmel, AeroFarms:So it's not just something that we thought, ""Oh, let's try this and see if it works out."" We've tried many, many different types of growth media, and we're continuing to explore this area and try to understand if there are better ways and better media to grow our plants, and whether that be every plant or for specific plants or for specific varieties. We are starting to hone in on different types of media that are helping us increase our farm productivity. So as you know, just like everybody else, we've got large buildings, we've got HVAC systems, but we're always working to try to understand what precise growing conditions we want to deliver to our plants, and we are also focusing pretty regularly on the ends of the process. So what happens during seeding? What happens during harvesting? So the more you focus on end-to-end process within a commercial farm, the better you're going to get. Every little thing counts.
Dr. Stacy Kimmel, AeroFarms:So it's critical for us to not just look at what's happening on the grow towers with the plants, but also think about what seeds are we sourcing? How are we treating those seeds? How are we placing those seeds on our growth media? What happens to those seeds once they get onto the tower? But then also once we bring them off, what are we doing when we harvest that? What are we doing when we package them? How are we packaging them? Are there environments that are better for us to be packaging to increase our shelf life so consumers get better quality? Just a lot of that work, it's all happening simultaneously, and we are... I think the one thing about AeroFarms that as you mentioned, that we know is different is we've got a lot of partnerships and those partnerships, while we have... We're working on different plants, we also... We're able to apply what we know to those plants and we're also able to apply information backwards.
Dr. Stacy Kimmel, AeroFarms:So it's great for us to learn from partners. We have a new facility that we're building in Abu Dhabi. So probably a lot of people who follow AeroFarms are familiar with this. That facility is going to be one of the largest R&D facilities in the world, focused on vertical farming. It's 100% research. Really excited about it. We have broken ground, we're building now, and things are progressing nicely. One of my team members was just there, sent pictures, and it's just like a sea of people working in that building, getting things ready for us to start up our laboratories and our grow rooms and put in our pilot farm into that facility so we can start working. So we're going to be employing local talent. We've got a number of focus areas. So plant biology is an obvious one, but we're also going to be looking at speed breeding, analytical chemistry, trying to understand what it is about the plants chemically and from a nutritional perspective and marrying that up with sensory understanding.
Dr. Stacy Kimmel, AeroFarms:Automation is a huge thing in vertical farming now. So we are going to be studying the different aspects of automation in farms for both leafy greens and other farms, whether it be in the vertical farm or in aspects of the farm on the front end or the back end, whether it be seeding or harvesting. So we're very excited about that. Roger talked a little bit about some of the other projects that we're doing relative to machine vision, but we'll also be doing some work there. So this is... It's a pretty exciting time to be at AeroFarms because we're committed to this research work, but I'll say that we don't do research for research's sake. We do research because we want to get to a commercial stage or for things that we are commercial, we're trying to improve and make those things better. So it's really exciting work to be doing. And I work with a great group of folks who are just excited about the science every day.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:Yeah. I think what's a huge advantage to indoor growing and the type of things that you do is that you're already gathering all that data anyway. And when you're growing outside, you don't have sensors so close and you're not collecting all that data. So you guys can actually make real time changes and really pick up data that is hard to do outside.
Dr. Stacy Kimmel, AeroFarms:Right. Exactly.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:Roger, do you want to add some to the R&D capabilities?
Roger Buelow, AeroFarms:Yeah. Let me... A few things to that. So one thing Stacy talked about the facility in Abu Dhabi, and one of the things that we're finding is working with local partners is it's really working out well for us. So there are plants of interest in the region that maybe in New Jersey is not as exciting, but in UAE, it is. And we have partnership with plenty of U.S. universities, but I'll tell you what? So leafy university, UAEU they're they're well staffed with some really smart people and that's turning out to be a fantastic set of partnerships also. I'll also go for further talking about machine vision. So we talked about the sensor network that's in there and you are right. One of the beautiful things about the vertical farming is you really have ubiquitous sensors. So you can make sure that you've got sensors in all the right places to make sure that you've got a really good view of what's happening with your plants.
Roger Buelow, AeroFarms:And Stacy's team, the R&D team has also developed different ways of doing machine vision so we can understand what's happening with the growth of the plants by looking at them post harvest, and we've made some great discoveries that way. And now, as we're moving forward, we mentioned we've published the fact that we have a partnership with Nokia Bell Labs and working hand in hand with them, we can set up systems that watch the plants while they're growing and in addition to watching the environmental factors. So I said ubiquitous, well, doesn't get much more ubiquitous than watching every plant every day and watching the environment around them. So that's already yielding great results in terms of paying very close attention to what's happening with the plants, being able to adjust our production systems, being able to adjust our forecasting when things are going better than expected, being able to marsh our resources if there's an issue that's popped up and we're able to pay very close attention to these plants and I think they appreciate it.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:Yeah. So you've both mentioned partnerships a couple of times and partnerships and collaborations are important to all companies, but AeroFarms is much more active in partnerships than a lot of the other companies in your space. I think partly because of the nature of IP and people being worried about that. But you guys have done a great job. So what about your culture makes that so? I mean, why do you think you have more partnerships and more collaborations than some of the other companies?
Roger Buelow, AeroFarms:I don't know that we do. I'm not keeping score.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:I am.
Roger Buelow, AeroFarms:I'll take your word for it. So when we lay out our principles at AeroFarms, collaboration is at the top of that list. So we have our set of principles. So communication is important, accountability is important, respect is important, but collaboration tends to be the one that you pivot outside and helps you have a broader view of what you can do on earth. So one way we put is that we want to grow the best plants for the better of humanity. Another way to say the same thing is we want to do the most good with our technology. And we believe that by partnering with others, we can do more good quicker. We can make sure that our technology makes an impact faster.
Roger Buelow, AeroFarms:So we think that's important to the planet. We think that's important to the company, and we look at it as a way to be agile in this market. These partnerships, we look to universities for partnerships. We look to other companies for partnerships too. And we mentioned we have a partnership with Hortifrut and publicly, we've talked about blueberries with Hortifrut and Hortifrut has the world's experts in terms of growing blueberries for production. They're really fantastic. And for us to take a step towards blueberries, it makes much more sense for us to partner up with Hortifruts of the world, than to try to go it alone and try to higher end because their culture has been built around how to keep those blueberry plants happy and how to breed them for the next millennia. It's a great place to start.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:Yeah. So you talked a bit about Nokia Bell Labs and as an example of the private technology partnerships that you have, and then Hortifrut as an example of your growing and kind of R&D partnerships. What other growing and R&D partnerships do you have that is public and you're talking about?
Roger Buelow, AeroFarms:I could talk about a few more of them. So we have been public to talk about a partnership with Cargill, where we are looking at cocoa and what we can do with cocoa plants, both growing indoors, and also being able to simulate really how climate change is going to affect those cocoa plants that are growing out in the world and giving some insights a little early on and also working through what does it mean to start a cocoa plant from scratch in a vertical farm in order to make sure that it's got the best chance of survival and the best yield once it gets out into the field? So we're looking at it from several different aspects and Cargill and Hortifrut and Nokia Bell Labs, those are all good examples of companies that we feel see the world similarly to the way that we see.
Roger Buelow, AeroFarms:So these are all companies that we're making a difference through technology and through investing in R&D is part of their culture. These are all companies that are looking to see what they can do to help out their customers, their consumers for decades to come. So that's a great match for us each step of the way. Sometimes you... So we are a B Corp. So sometimes that's a shorthand way to go is to talk about other companies that are B Corps. It's a quick way to say, ""All right. I think we're pretty well aligned."" I mentioned one more that we've made public, and that is a project where we are growing hops with AB InBev. So again, this is partnering with the company with the scale to have a good view of what's happening for the genetics of their plants, and also a great understanding of what's important for their market.
Roger Buelow, AeroFarms:And I love to see people's faces when we talk about growing hops plants, because they're so different than growing a micro green, and it's another example of staying flexible and agile with our technology and making the most of it and seeing all these different ways we can help out.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:So do you... When you grow hops inside, I mean, I've seen them outside and they're... For those people who haven't seen hops grow, the first time I saw the set up, I'm like, ""What the heck is that?"" But you have to... It's a very long trellis that goes up to this thing that the plant goes up. Can you shorten that or can you do some internode work where there the internodes aren't as long and you get more hops for stem or is that a secret?
Dr. Stacy Kimmel, AeroFarms:Well, I mean, I think... They're really, really tall plants. There's potentially opportunity for genetics there to be more suitable for indoor farms, but I think part of the cool thing that we do is when we start out with something, we tend to start with what other folks are using. And if you are familiar at all with that project, because of the press release, and you look at the beer that was brewed, it was brewed with cascade hops. So cascade hops are... Every hop farmer grows cascade hops. They're one of... They're very, very popular flavor hop right now. Have been for a while. They're tall plants. But a lot of what we do is try to figure out are there things that would allow us to grow that tall plant uniquely within a grow room?
Dr. Stacy Kimmel, AeroFarms:So we have a tremendous engineering staff and they are incredibly creative. So without giving away the farm, so to speak, we've figured out how to manage some of those tall plants when they get tall. And there are aspects of that that are about that growing that's about the plant, and there are aspects of about that how do we manage the stature of the plant in the type of situation that we're dealing with? And hop was a interesting challenge for us, but we did figure that out and it was a quite a creative solution. So it's exciting that we were able to do that. On the one partnership that I'll mention that Roger didn't mention, and it's probably more related to the B Corp side of our company is our partnership with Jersey City and the World Economic Forum.
Dr. Stacy Kimmel, AeroFarms:So this is a partnership related to community farms. So we are building community farms and putting them... We've committed... In the first year, the project put 10 community farms in schools, in city buildings within the city of Jersey City, and we just put our first one in. The farm was designed, it was tested, it was built, and the first one went out two weeks ago, and it is growing plants in a school. This is historically something that AeroFarms has done. Ed Harwood worked with schools in the Newark area. It was a big passion of his. So it's exciting that we're able to continue that legacy in a much bigger program, and I think Jersey City is just really the start of this because there's a... I mean, a lot of people are interested in how do they bring this technology on a smaller scale to... It could be many, many places.
Dr. Stacy Kimmel, AeroFarms:It could be inside of a cafeteria at a corporation. It could be at a grocery store. There could be a lot of places that you could place these types of farms, and we're excited that the first ones out there and growing for the school kids and they're able to learn about different plants and they actually can do some small experiments on the growing system. They can look at turning on the lights and turning off the lights. They can change the amount of water that they're giving to plants. There's a lot of cool things that they can do to learn science while they're in school and also grow vegetables at the same time. So that is another cool partnership that we have that I think fits really nicely with what we're trying to do as a company and a B Corp.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:I love that. I hadn't heard of that. That's great. So what about public partnerships? What have you got going there? I know the PIP that you're involved in has gotten a lot of press. So you want to tell us about that?
Roger Buelow, AeroFarms:Yeah. I'd love to talk about the PIP program. So PIP stands for precision indoor plants, and it's a consortium between both FFRA, the Foundation for Food and Agriculture Research and a group of companies. So AeroFarms is happy to be part of that executive committee in this consortium, but also BASF is here, Preva, Fluence, Benson Hill and Green Venus. This brings people to the table from across the supply chain and with lots of different views in terms of where we can go forward with indoor farming and very particularly, vertical farming. The question that PIP has focused on is genetics for indoor farms. So even more particularly, we've announced that we want to focus on lettuce, strawberries and tomatoes, and work on co-optimizing genetics and environment, and that's why you have genetics companies and environment companies on the same team.
Roger Buelow, AeroFarms:The first one that we've started on is lettuce, and that's working out well right out of the gates. So we are using some of our technology to speed up the generation to generation the seed to seed time for the lettuce itself, and that speed breeding is certainly helpful to get many more generations per year into the system so that we can move very quickly towards having the right lettuce favorable for farming, but it's also helping develop the technology that can be used with many other plants in many other ways. So I think that it is blazing a trail for a broader use of speed breeding by taking advantage of everything vertical farming brings to the table.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:Great. So you told us quite a bit about R&D and the origins of the company as it got built up, but Roger, maybe you can take us... Talk a little bit about commercialization strategies, how you thought about that, and then let's move in, after that, move into what the future looks like for AeroFarms and where guys are headed.
Roger Buelow, AeroFarms:Sure. I can start out and Stacy, you can jump in at any point too. So when we think about our history of commercialization, AeroFarms, we started out expecting that local was going to be everything. And that was even built into our philosophies at the start. And part of what we found was that yes, people love local produce, but the quality of our produce is really what makes people fanatical about wanting to have our baby leafy greens and microgreens. So the R&D team works on how to drive more flavor, how to drive more vitamin content into the greens that we grow today. So, as we talk about our history, starting with baby leafy greens, that was already great, but the microgreens are fantastic.
Roger Buelow, AeroFarms:The flavor is... It's really off the charts. It's my favorite for sure. The vitamin content's off the charts, and I think that we're seeing more and more pull for the microgreens and for very good reasons. So as we're going forward, we're expecting to see more and more of that. Let me just put it as we wouldn't be surprised if more and more pull, more and more demand is there for the microgreens. We have talked about where and how we make decisions on setting up commercial farms. I think there's a few things that we made public that talk about that. I won't go into all of that here, but I will mention that we are in the middle of setting up our next commercial farm in Daniel, Virginia. So if you've ever been to Daniel, Virginia, I encourage you to go.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:I've actually spent more time there than most people probably have. So I can imagine it's great for the community as well. That's a great place to put a farm as far as giving employment to the area and just, yeah, great pick.
Roger Buelow, AeroFarms:So we're excited about it and the... I actually have up on my screen, well, as I'm talking to you of a live feed of the construction site and it's pretty far along. So that farm will start out for sure with baby leafy greens and microgreens. We've also have been public by saying that we're going to go to St. Louis as our farm that serves the Midwest next, and we've published some maps that suggest a few other locations in North America, in addition to how Stacy listed out this world's largest R&D farm going up in UAE that both the government in UAE and in Abu Dhabi in particular and AeroFarms, we both think that this is going to be the anchor for expansion of really high efficiency, vertical farming in the region.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:Great. Anything you want to add there, Stacy?
Dr. Stacy Kimmel, AeroFarms:Sure. Yeah. I mean, I'd like to expand a little bit on the microgreen aspects and some of the points that Roger touched on relative to what is so special about those. I think it's a unique category and as consumers are starting to look for new things as they shop the produce section, it definitely is a standout. It's not something that you typically see when you go to the grocery store, and we just launched this year, for new varieties of microgreens. One of them is a broccoli, which is an outstanding item and Whole Foods identified it as one of their 2022 flavor trends was AeroFarms' micro broccoli. So it's gotten some great press and we're really excited about how people are coming, looking for microgreens because it's not something... Baby leafy greens are all over the place, right? So we definitely grow those and we have great baby leafy greens, but microgreens are fabulous and I think really driving consumers to the category and to our brand, because it's something that we do that's unique.
Dr. Stacy Kimmel, AeroFarms:Related to the flavor, if you had been following us for some time, you know that we had our greens branded Just Greens our greens branded Dream Greens, and our company was called AeroFarms. So this summer, we rolled out a new brand, which is really fabulous, if you get a chance to take a look at it. Every part of the logo, every color on those packages was selected to represent both our past and our future as a company. So it was very deliberate. So it's hard to know that unless you're really inside of our company, but know that there was a lot of thought put into it. We have the biggest product window on shelf.
Dr. Stacy Kimmel, AeroFarms:So consumers can look at our products and see straight through that front part of the pack and see what they're buying, which is terrific, and we've got all these cool colors on the packages and they aren't just cool colors. They actually stand for something. They stand for a flavor spectrum. So each color of the package represents a flavor, the flavor in the variety that's in the package. So the colors range from blue, cool flavors to red, spicy, and zesty and all different colors in between. So when you're looking at the greens, you can see the greens, but you can also sense from the color and the information on the package, what you're going to taste when you actually buy them. So it's not just, ""Here's a package of greens and you're not sure what you're going to get. I'll give it a try and see what it is,"" you know before you even buy it, what you're going to get, what it's going to taste like just based on the cues from the color and from the other information on the package.
Dr. Stacy Kimmel, AeroFarms:So that's really cool. And recently, we launched a Flavorhub. So if you're really, really excited about flavor, you can go and join that group on our website and you can get giveaways and all kinds of cool stuff and learn more about flavor and our products and you can follow us on social media through that Flavorhub as well. So that's a really... A new marketing aspect that we're bringing to that branding that just launched this month. So we launched the brand with the flavor spectrum and then we've got this new Flavorhub coming right behind it to engage consumers and really educate them on flavor and produce.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:That's great. I think it's a great place to wrap up here and just really thinking about all the R&D that you guys are involved in and then how it ends up on the shelf and these new products that everybody loves and the taste is great. And please bring them to California at some point. So thank you both so much. I really appreciate your time and your enthusiasm about the company really shines through. So great culture and I will talk to you again in another time. Thank you.

Vonnie Estes, PMA:Welcome to PMA Takes on Tech, the podcast that explores the problems, solutions, people and ideas that are shaping the future of the produce industry. I'm your host Vonnie Estes, Vice President of Technology for the Produce Marketing Association, and I've spent years in the AgTech sector. So I can attest, it's hard to navigate this ever changing world in developing and adopting new solutions to industry problems.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:Thanks for joining us, and for allowing us to serve as your guide to the new world of produce and technology. My goal of the podcast, is to outline a problem in the produce industry, and then discuss several possible solutions that can be deployed today.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:This season of PMA Takes on Tech is bought to you by Plenty. Plenty is an indoor vertical farm, that sustainably grows produce using less water and land than traditional farming, and no pesticides or GMOs. The farm is able to grow peak season flavorful food year round, and deliver fresh produce to its retail partners daily. Plenty's proprietary towers, and intelligent platform, make it the only vertical farm that can grow multiple crops with consistently superior flavors and yield.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:Hello, you are going to love my conversation with Sonia Lo. Sonia is an indoor farmer, a chef, an angel investor, and a mother of two, who speaks seven languages, and holds a third degree black belt in TaeKwonDo. Sonia has over 32 years of combined agriculture, technology and business experience. In the industry, Sonia was CEO of Crop One Holdings, Inc., a vertical farming company that owns FreshBox Farms and a joint venture with Emirates Flight Catering in Dubai. Most recently, Sonia was the CEO of Sensei Ag, an AgTech company focusing on CEA, founded by Larry Ellison in Hawaii. Sonia was appointed one of the Global 100 Technology Pioneers at the World Economic Forum two years in a row, and named one of Management Today's leading 35 business women in the UK under the age of 35.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:This conversation goes where most do not in indoor Ag. With Sonia's unique experience and view of the industry, we spend time on business models and financing, which are huge issues in CEA right now. But we also talk a lot about the political economy of CEA, the problems with lack of diversity, creating a eco-system and how the industry needs to openly monitor, share and compare data on cost structure and carbon footprint. So fun, check it out, let's drop into the conversation with Sonia.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:Welcome Sonia, so tell us about your background and your journey in controlled environment agriculture.
Sonia Lo, Chalsys LLP:Thanks Vonnie for having me, it's great to see you again. So I generally work for myself as the world's unlikeliest lady farmer. Because I came into vertical farming because I'd invested in a vertical farming venture, and became the ultimate in active investor when I ended up stepping in to venture interim CEO, and then the interim title fell away two years later, and then six and a half years later I was still the CEO of that venture.
Sonia Lo, Chalsys LLP:And then I was recruited away by a wonderful venture that was looking to transform human wellness, founded by Larry Ellison, he of Oracle fame, and Dr. David Agus, a world famous oncologist and scientist. So my journey in CEA has been varied, between vertical farms, greenhouses of multiple farm factors, different geographies, and a widely varying capital mix as well as crop mix.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:So what about vertical farming as you first started getting into it. What drew you to it from some of the other things you did before? And what got your passion aroused for vertical farming?
Sonia Lo, Chalsys LLP:So the food value chain has always interested me. After the sale of my first venture I ended up actually going to culinary school and being a chef.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:Really?
Sonia Lo, Chalsys LLP:Yes. Being a chef in London for two years. Which I absolutely adored, it's probably the hardest job I've ever had in my life. You're up at the crack of dawn, you're soliciting ingredients, you're thinking through the day's menu, and then you're still on your feet at 11 o'clock at night. But I loved it, have just adored feeding people and being in Europe for 20 years, there is such a focus on the food supply chain, about eating locally, eating seasonally, and using those wonderful ingredients. And that really became part of my DNA, and when I moved back to the US, the very long supply chain, the fact that 40% of post consumer food is thrown away because it is spoiled, other people think it's spoiled. There's so much about our food supply chain that doesn't work, and I don't think it's going to be tenable to feed 10 billion people on the planet within the next 30 years.
Sonia Lo, Chalsys LLP:So when I looked at vertical farming and the potential for basically climate agnostic growing, I thought, ""Wow this is amazing."" And of course all entrepreneurs in vertical farming represent a set of unit economics which are aspirational, and over the last eight and a half, nine years, I haven't seen that much that has moved the unit economics. I keep hearing of improved yields through the use of automation, I keep hearing of better energy optimization. But ultimately I think we have to figure out a path to profitability for vertical farming, otherwise this industry is going to remain very interesting and niche, but it's not really going to overcome the energy balances.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:Yeah, definitely is a challenge. I'd like to talk a bit about business models and financing, and these are areas that you're uniquely qualified to speak about from your numerous industry leadership roles and backgrounds in markets and investing. So with a lot of the companies that we're talking about, there's a lot of outside investments, so there's always a need for an exit. We've had some high profile SPACs and some IPOs. Can you talk about this and what's working and what's not working around investing, exits and business models.
Sonia Lo, Chalsys LLP:Oh gosh. Well, I guess there's always a little bit of a crystal ball exercise, right? And I don't have one. But I do think that SPACs are here to stay, as an instrument, and I think they are important. But I think that for early stage companies, potentially pre revenue companies, to be going to market to a SPAC is a very difficult path. Because for SPAC arrangers to get their money back, and for the underwriter to get their money back, the target has to be two or three x the value of the cash. And while Venture Valuations and private have their own rationale, I think when you play that out in the public market it can become very uncomfortable, and I think that that sort of rationality is behind some of the more recent failures to merge, that we've witnessed, right. And I think that the private capital markets are efficient, I think they're good at understanding what the risks are, and playing out the governance that needs to happen with some of these earlier stage companies, and the private world is far better to do, then doing so on a public stage, right. And I think that in terms of venture capital, venture capital at least in the vertical farming area has to be very crisp, ha-ha pun intended. About the segregation of the real asset which is the farm from the technology access, and the technology investment that it's making.
Sonia Lo, Chalsys LLP:How you actually start to monetize that technology is as of yet unclear, right. Because nobody per se, is actually selling the technology, they're not selling a robot, they're not selling an automation line. The initial foray into this was lighting, oh we've found another set of LED lights, that are somehow going to improve your yield some tiny percentage, hasn't turned out to be true. Lighting is a cost based analysis for most vertical farmers, though I hope that the venture return from all of the capital is going to come from more than the real asset that they have invested in today, which is the farm. Because if you look at the ROI on these farms, even with full automation, even with great energy optimization and chasing two to three or six cents a kilowatt hour energy profile. Your returns are still in the nice private equity level returns, maybe mid-teens, low twenties, they're not 80, 90, right. So I think that segregation, the trajectory, the monetization of the technology, is going to be incredibly important for that venture promise to come true.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:Yeah, one thing I'd be interested in your thought on the SPACs. I spent a lot of years in industrial biotech, and one of the things I'm watching is some of those companies going public through SPACs, and then some of the other companies, not just indoor farms that have used SPACs that are more in biology and it's more on... Technology has not proven yet, and I just wonder if investors, it just seems that's hard for investors to kind of understand. So you see these companies IPO through a SPAC, and then the stock tanks when people start looking at, well you don't really have any revenues, or, you're not going to make any revenues. So is it just a different kind of investment thesis that people aren't making cereal, or tables, or cars or something. They're actually making something that doesn't have revenue yet and is kind of on the cuff, and is a public market place the right place for that to play out?
Sonia Lo, Chalsys LLP:So, biotech is certainly not my area of expertise, but I am familiar enough with companies that are, no revenue, but high growth, high impact. And I think that, if the management of the investor expectations is consistent. Which is, ""No, we don't have revenue,"" ""No, profit is not a target,"" and what we're building is an enzyme, we're building a biological process, we're building a biological platform, and that's what your capital is going to do. I think there are enough exit models, which is essential you build enough of the science that it becomes a viable proof point for one of the major biotech companies to buy you out, right. It is a publicly traded stock, an easier and more valuable way for major to buy you out, yeah, maybe. I just don't think we've seen that, and then the problem is that these are all micro-cap or mid-cap companies when they come to the market, and 80% of your shares value, when you are a micro-cap is external, it has nothing to do with your intrinsic value. So you're going to get tossed around like a little bow in the ocean, and I think that's also very hard for management teams that are not accustomed to navigating in the public markets.
Sonia Lo, Chalsys LLP:So there kind of learning curves for everybody, but I think, again, SPACs are here to stay, I think they're a valuable instrument, and I think that there will be good target to bring to market.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:So back to CEA and just looking at what business models and financing could work better. I think, funding a farm with IPO money or even venture money, is a pretty expensive way to fund a farm, and you wouldn't do that if you were growing outside. So, should we be looking more at project financing, or are there different ways to kind of fund the growth of this industry that might put us in a better position?
Sonia Lo, Chalsys LLP:I think the industry has to move to project financing, otherwise, you're only going to see four farms out there. I think these are big heavy lifting machines, even greenhouses, greenhouses can certainly be cheap and cheerful, if they are the kind of low cost hoop houses. But those of course don't work all over the country, and they certainly don't work year round. So your cost per square foot of a vertical farm, or something where the climate is controllable, but say within 80% variability. Then, these ticket prices get large, and for the average farmer, they're well out of the reach of the average farmer, and there also isn't an infrastructure to support, there isn't a financing infrastructure or a logistical infrastructure, that supports indoor growing yet.
Sonia Lo, Chalsys LLP:So I think the sort of opco/propco model, where there is a technology company, there is an operating management team, sort of like hotel management, is the future. I don't see anybody who's done that yet, who has built their own farms, proven that they can operate at certain yields, and then gone out to other farmers and said, ""Hey, do this, we'll give you the playbook and you go off and be the grower."" I think these sort of, the co-op models that have existed, thus far with open field growing, are closest to that. Where there is a co-operative of farmers that come together, they each agree to grow within certain seasons, everybody gets paid even if there's a crop failure. That's a powerful model in the open field world, I think that is probably, because of course catastrophic greenhouse failure, catastrophic vertical farm failure does occur, and the industry needs to get to the point where it can mitigate that. So I think you will start to see co-operative networks come together, I think you also have to start to look at multi farm factor. Because even if you're on a vertical farm and you are ostensibly climate agnostic, you still have to heat and cool that building, you still have to de-humidify the building envelope to the external environment. So there are costs and design engineering implications to all of that.
Sonia Lo, Chalsys LLP:So again, I think if we're really aiming for a future where indoor growing is dotting the landscape, I think you have to see a migration to the opco/propco model. I think you have to start to see co-operative networks, I think you have to start to see multi farm factor with the relevant expertise that needs to happen for that to occur. And then finally I think you bring along the insurers and the financiers, because again, if indoor growing is going to become a permanent shift in agricultural infrastructure, then in 10 years it would be wonderful if we could see indoor farms financed by municipal bond issuers. We're a long ways off of that, a long ways off of that, and even today with big greenhouse growers, they self-insure, because the insurance companies, they say, ""Well, I don't know how to write a policy on a new greenhouse.""
Vonnie Estes, PMA:Wow, interesting. So there's no eco-system really to support this all industry yet?
Sonia Lo, Chalsys LLP:No.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:Interesting.
Sonia Lo, Chalsys LLP:Not yet, not yet. Which is why it's amazing and terrific that Venture Capital has taken the first step to finance this. But if they... We're going to build a machine, that machine is going to be very precise and we're going to be able to speak to the risk parameters of all of those machines, and we're going to drop these machines across landscape, until one of the machines doesn't work. So when I first started out in this industry, now almost nine years ago, I reached out to my fellow CEOs across landscape and I said, ""I think we have to share information, I think we have to share data, because otherwise all of us are going to be in these silos of Venture Capital. I was met with a wall-
Vonnie Estes, PMA:And how did that go?
Sonia Lo, Chalsys LLP:... I was met with a wall of silence. I started my life many, many, many years ago professionally in telecoms, and in so many ways it was the perfect grounding for understanding the digitization of anything. Because everything is predicated on I's and O's, as I said to my first big media boss, three decades ago. And with agriculture, the digitization has to have a point, and the point is not just improved yields and the ability to see and ace it on a leaf. The digitization really is because you're driving the lowering of risk, and then once you've lowered risk, or you can quantify risk adequately and in a way that is transparent, then you're kind of off to the races.
Sonia Lo, Chalsys LLP:But these are big machines, and I think what it really means as well is that these are natural oligopolies. We spoke earlier about biotech, biotech has 10 major companies in it, and a bunch of tiny start-ups, because it takes that much money to actually get a product to market. With telecom why have we gone through the break-up of AT&T, back to AT&T? And only four major telcos. Oh, well cable, why do we only have four cable choices? Cable is effectively a monopoly, and it's because the heavy lifting required an infrastructure essentially settled into an actual oligopoly. And I think that the same is going to be true of digitized agriculture, there are going to be 10 competitors, all of whom make good profile, not supernormal profit, but good profile. And where they have borne the cost of digitizing the risk of making the risk transparent, and then they basically have that share of the market.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:But do you think those companies will be actual producers, or will they be the developers of the technology that then gets either licensed or sold or whatever to people? Because actually, production is never where you make the money, I mean, it's hard to make money in producing food. And so, when you say there's going to be like four companies, what part of the chain will they be in do you think?
Sonia Lo, Chalsys LLP:I think there'll be more than four companies, because food and agriculture is such an enormous value chain. I think it will be possible to make money at every step of the way, so I think it will be more akin to the hotel industry. So, there will be the big brands like the Four Seasons, the Ritz-Carlton's, and their playbook and their brand gets issued to a variety of smaller hotel owners who own the property. But the property owners make their money too. [crosstalk 00:24:12].
Vonnie Estes, PMA:Okay, so you see it that it will be set up that people will be able to make money in the chain?
Sonia Lo, Chalsys LLP:Yeah, because I think if you look at what's happened with some of these more... You squeeze the grower model, where you own the germ plasm, you own the seedling, you provide the grower with the seedling and then you become the only market for that grower after they've grown the product. The grower has seen their margins collapse from 30% to three, and at some point people go, ""I don't want to grow for you anymore, I can make more money being an independent grower, sowing my stuff directly."" And that's also the great kind of liberation of vertical farming, right, is, ""I don't want to be part of your squeeze me distribution and packing play anymore, I actually am going to go direct to consumer, I'm going to go direct to retailer."" And that's what has shaken up Salinas. They don't believe the unit economics yet, and so every time I speak to one of the big packers, they all go, ""Yeah, pretty niche still,"" but they're keeping a keen eye on it, that's for sure.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:Yeah, and one of things that I'm watching and kind of wondering how it's going to play out is, I think a lot of our growers, producers in places like Salinas or Florida. That's what they do and they kind of own a part of the supply chain. As we have more climate problems, like here in California, less water. Those producers are going to want to mitigate the risk.
Sonia Lo, Chalsys LLP:Wild fires.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:Yeah, exactly, smoke. And they're going to want to mitigate their risk, so you are starting to see some of the big producers, Salinas type producers start to get interested in this. And so, I'm really curious in how this is going to play out as more of the really large producers, packers, shippers, in Salinas are going to say, ""Okay I want to mitigate my risk and get into indoor..."" And then does that change this whole kind of infrastructure thing and eco-system that we were talking about? Do they kind of take it over or does indoor Ag, kind of create its own? I mean this is all speculation, neither of us know, but I was just kind of wondering what you thought about that.
Sonia Lo, Chalsys LLP:I think right now, the valuation between indoor Ag and outdoor, the packers, the big packers prospective on their valuation is so vast, there isn't anybody willing to cross that chasm. They look at the valuations of these indoor growers that have a million dollars in revenue and they just go, right? I mean, that was the sound of me guffawing. So, for right now, I don't think the big packers are likely exits, I think they are potential partners, but I think for most indoor growers, they look at what the packers want them to do, which is kind of set up outside their DCs, and let their engineers crawl all over the operation. They're just thinking, ""Well they're going to watch us do two cycles of this and they'll build their own, and then they'll be vertically integrated and then I'm good."" I don't think that's going to be true, I think there are enough bells and whistles now in the more mature indoor growing operators and in the indoor growing technologies, that it's still a two year development cycle.
Sonia Lo, Chalsys LLP:And so, I think the packers are very prudent excellent business people who at some point will agree that a partnership is the right way to go, and I had a very thoughtful discussion with the CEO and chairman of one of the big packers, and he said, there will be partnerships, the partnerships are going to be where indoor growing has massive strength, like seedling production. And I think if you can create a hardened seedling in an indoor growing environment in a vertical farm where you're getting 98, 99% germination rates, and then transport those to open field, that's a logical and very comfortable fix. I think the costs of open field growing are... there's so much infrastructure around open field growing, you can lease the land, you can lease cold storage, you can buy occasional time in a packers line. There is already massive investment in automation in the packer, for an indoor farmer to replicate at the scale of some of the big packers, is who knows how long away. So definitely large potential for partnership, again, as exits I think the big packers are just going, ""I can't get my head around the valuation."" Which is why you also haven't seen so much investment from the big packers into the indoor growers.
Sonia Lo, Chalsys LLP:I think also some of it is geography. That the indoor farmers haven't really started in California, they've started on the East Coast, where their product is going to be most differentiated. And it's a big country, and it's two very different business cultures. So you get the smart New Yorker's, you get the smart Bostonian's, who are doing very well now, growing for the North East markets, and California going, ""Yeah, they're kind of not really hurting us,"" yet. Now what's interesting is to see the big greenhouse growers enter the fray, because greenhouse production is well known, there is a full automation suite. There is a whole financing infrastructure for greenhouses, if you're buying Dutch, and I think they are the real competitors to the vertical farms. Because they can come in at a lower price point, their product is as good, and I think the vertical farmers have always taken on this sort of, ""The open field is our competition,"" but actually I think greenhouses and their real competition.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:How interesting, and they are doing more variety, at least for now, they're doing a more variety of products then leafy greens and herbs and so they can do more. So switching a little bit to looking at the political economy of CEA, so a lot of people are getting involved in the conversation of saying, ""We don't really want really rich companies in charge of our food,"" and, ""Who profits from growing this food?"", and ""Should there be B Corps?"", and ""Should there be worker ownership?"" So we don't really put big outdoor Ag under this scrutiny. But I'm just starting to hear these conversations around CEA of really, should the indoor Ag vertical farming industry be more attuned to workers’ rights, and not controlling our food system in a way that we may not want. Do you have any thoughts on that?
Sonia Lo, Chalsys LLP:On the question of corporate structure, which is whether these companies should be B Corps and what that really means, and worker ownership. I think that indoor Ag and AgTech probably is one of the greatest potential areas for crossing the political divide. I think it empowers people of all backgrounds, I think it creates a next generation of knowledge workers, but instead of having to have a degree in computer science you can have a degree in anything, and you cannot have a degree. You can come from a background, where you are good with your hands and have good attention to detail.
Sonia Lo, Chalsys LLP:So I think that it is an amazing entry point to the knowledge economy. Having said that, trying to explain a sort of VC option structure to somebody who works in a farm all day is a challenge. So I do think that the well-trodden path of tech options, probably not the right compensation structure. I think co-operative ownership programs, where you've got a collection of growers, yeah, something like that, and each grower then administers their HR according to their own market conditions, sure, collaborative ownership structures. The question is, how far down do you push that ownership.
Sonia Lo, Chalsys LLP:I think the issue of B Corps are much murkier, I'm not sure of whether or not the designation of the B Corp actually certifies you as anything. I don't think there is enough knowledge yet across the market of what it means to be a B Corp as a grower or even as a AgTech operator. Then I think there is the thornier issue of whether or not indoor Ag is actually green-
Vonnie Estes, PMA:Yes, let's dig into that too. I definitely wanted to talk to you about just with... That's one of the big selling points of, ""This is so much more sustainable, our carbon footprint is great."" So I'd love to hear your thoughts on, how we look at that, and how we're measuring it, and really keeping ourselves honest in that area.
Sonia Lo, Chalsys LLP:... Yeah, so again, I think indoor Ag is all about the transformation of energy into calories, and unless you have a robust accounting of your energy consumptions, and that conversation into calories, you are going to have a hard time defending your green credentials.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:Say more about that, how does that kind of play out?
Sonia Lo, Chalsys LLP:Yeah, so if your vertical farm is growing on coal fire power, you don't have a green leg to stand on. And you can argue, how close you are to the consumer, you can argue the fact that you don't have all these refrigeration miles. But there are numbers out there for what it costs you in terms of carbon output to do open field growing of a leafy green in Salinas, or numbers out there on what it costs you in terms of carbon output to refrigerate that leafy green and drive it to New York. There are very few numbers around what it costs to move water around, just because that's the kind of awful dirty little secret, and then there are no numbers, right now, around what your carbon emissions are if you're depending on the energy source that you're using as a vertical farm.
Sonia Lo, Chalsys LLP:So, if you're going to build your own plant, fine great, but if you're going to build a one ton a day vertical farm, growing leafy greens, it's three and a half megawatts of power is required, on a footprint of, now I've seen leafy greens growers at 30,000 square feet. So you've got 30,000 square feet of vertical farm, growing one ton a day, phenomenal, phenomenal land use. If you're going to solar power, that one ton a day farm, you're going to require 20 acres of land, but the panels. So not a viable land use calculation.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:Yeah.
Sonia Lo, Chalsys LLP:So, I think the industry has to start to look at combination energy sources, and siting, site selection is going to really matter. Greenhouses of course, not as energy intensive because they're using daylight, but if you get the daylight wrong, then you're never going to develop the brick that you need. You're going to need supplemental lighting, you're going to need supplemental heating and cooling and desiccation, and whoop, your energy balances go completely out of whack in a greenhouse as well. So again, transparency, a sharing of information, all of these things may be initially painful, but I think they're necessary if the industry as a whole is going to claim green credentials that are factual.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:Yeah, and I think a lot of companies that I talk to say, just the same as some of the cost structure stuff. Were working on it, were getting there. And I think that's true, I think we need this nascent industry to grow and improve. But we also need to start having ways to kind of monitor how it's growing and improving, and so, I can see both with cost structures and just kind of carbon footprint, that we need to work together and share information to kind of understand that.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:One last kind of big area I'd love to touch with you on, is the incredible lack of diversity in we could probably say most of Ag, but just focusing on CEA, we can start there. Just looking at founders, investors, board members, C-suite. You can just look across the industry, we just don't see much diversity. So I'm sure, you are many times the only woman in the room, as I have been throughout my career. What can we do? Are there some positive things that, I can do, you can do, the industry can do, and how do we kind of change this lack of diversity?
Sonia Lo, Chalsys LLP:Gosh, that is a very big question, and I think it's one that is repeated across boardrooms irrespective of sector, right. I think in indoor Ag, just the price of entry, whether it's the cost of building a high-tech glasshouse or whether it's the cost of building a vertical farm, means that you are caught up in the dearth of capital overall that goes to women and non-binary gender recipients of that capital, and forget people of color. At one point they had a slide of the leadership in AgTech, and there was one woman, needless to say there was only one woman of color, and there was one other brown face on the page, and everybody else was a guy in a Patagonia vest. And so, again, I think this is where, if you make data transparent, if you make the risk of each farm really more machine driven, then I think it almost doesn't matter who is running the farm.
Sonia Lo, Chalsys LLP:I think if you were to dig down into three star hotel ownership across the country, that carry a Hyatt or a Hilton Garden Inn brand, you'd see a lot of brown and black faces. I mean, I think you'd start to see that the businesses, because they're so well known as businesses and as franchises, that the ownership of the asset becomes irrelevant. Now, the playbook for the asset, Hilton, or Marriott or any of these, is that it's still concentrated in the hands of a few, yeah, but what they border risk, to kind of get it up to that playbook status where a hundred room Hilton Garden Inn is a well-known, well financeable model.
Sonia Lo, Chalsys LLP:We're not there yet with indoor Ag, so I think the rules of venture capital still apply and the reality is that, venture capital, 2% of that goes to women, I'm sure some minuscule percentage goes to women of color. So, I don't think you're going to solve the diversity issue through legislation, because then what happens is that you get capital flight from that. I think you're going to solve it through making the asset category easier to allocate to and by making risk more transparent.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:Great. Well, before I let you go. What is next for you? You're kind of in a transition, and I'm excited to hear what you're thinking about and what's next for you.
Sonia Lo, Chalsys LLP:Gosh, I've accepted a couple of board roles. I had an existing board role with a private company that is amazing, that is a purpose driven organization and on this board I'm honored to serve. The other two roles are, working in the low carbon economy, which I believe has to become the economy.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:Yes.
Sonia Lo, Chalsys LLP:And working in the design engineering space for indoor Ag, and I believe that again breakthroughs are going to come from that ability to see across farm factors, across how people are growing, and then apply and share that knowledge. I think the design engineering nexus is where a lot of this information sharing and knowledge sharing is going to occur. So the board roles allow me to keep my hand in right now, while I make a decision on, sort of, what's next. I'm probably not quite ready for it to be a full time portfolio career, where I serve on five or six different boards, but it depends on the boards. And then I've had approaches from people that want me to helm something else, I'll make a decision sometime in the early new year.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:Watch this space, right? Well thank you so much Sonia for your insight into the industry. I think you have a very unique insight into this young industry with a great lens, and I think we touched on a number of things that people don't usually talk about. So I really appreciate your openness and willingness to have this conversation. So, thank you.

This is the first episode in the last season of 2021 and is focused on Controlled Environment Ag. Nate starts off explaining CEA; it’s benefits and challenges. We talk about how Plenty improves food security, safety and availability. Unlike most vertical farms, Plenty grows on vertical towers instead of flatbeds. Nate has a great description on how this came about and the advantages. We also have an enlightening conversation on breeding for vertical farms. Whether you are a practitioner or are new to vertical farming, you will learn something from this engaging discussion.

Vonnie Estes, PMA:Welcome to PMA Takes On Tech, the podcast that explores the problems, solutions, people, and ideas that are shaping the future of the produce industry. I'm your host, Vonnie Estes, vice-president of Technology for the Produce Marketing Association, and I've spent years in the ag tech sector. So I can attest, it's hard to navigate this ever-changing world in developing and adopting new solutions to industry problems.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:Thanks for joining us and for allowing us to serve as your guide to the new world of produce and technology. My goal of the podcast is to outline a problem in the produce industry and then discuss several possible solutions that can be deployed today.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:This last season of 2021 will be focused on controlled environment ag, and as sponsored by one of the leaders in the industry, Plenty. Plenty as an indoor vertical farming company that uses less space and fewer resources to grow flavorful, healthy, fresh, and clean produce, year-round. Plenty's mission is to improve the lives of plant, people, and our planet
Vonnie Estes, PMA:Regulars of the podcast know I love talking to Nate story, CSO and co-founder of Plenty. We have had several conversations in the past episode, 23 with Scott Komar on Plenty's relationship with Driscoll's, and episode 30 on food safety. I wanted him to kick off this season to give a good snapshot of vertical farming now. Whether you are a practitioner or know nothing about vertical farming, you will learn something from our discussion.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:We cover the advantages and challenges of indoor farming. We talk about the origin of Plenty's proprietary towers and intelligent platform that allow it to grow multiple crops with consistent flavors and yield near the. Near the end of the conversation, I ask Nate about breeding, one of my favorite topics, for indoor farms. I challenge any breeding companies to get back to me with a different point of view. I'll do an episode on it if we get some feedback. Let's drop into my conversation with Nate.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:This episode is the start of my season on a controlled environment ag. So for those who might not be familiar, can you explain a little bit what CEA, is and what Plenty does, and a little bit about yourself, Nate?
Nate Storey:Yeah. So CEA is Controlled Environment Ag. And historically, this has been mostly in reference to greenhouses. So greenhouses basically took field conditions and said, hey, how do we control more control, more control, more? And you end up in these buildings where they're much more controlled than the field. A lot of time they're growing things like tomatoes, tropical fruit in the Netherlands places. Definitely not the tropics.
Nate Storey:And in the last couple of decades, we've really kind of taken this idea of control a little bit further, right? So greenhouses are mature industry. This is like the mature CA industry. And what's happened is the indoor farmers have kind of come along and have built upon the CA concept and said, what happens when we have more and more and more control over the environment? Well, the outcome is you get more and more and more yield. You get more and more and more quality. So today, CEA kind of encompasses both greenhouses and indoor farming, but my world is almost entirely indoor farming.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:Hmm. Interesting. So who is Plenty, and how long has the company been around, and what do you all do?
Nate Storey:Yeah. So Plenty is an indoor farming company. So we grow entirely under artificial light. So the greenhouse, they get some natural light and then they've got a lot of supplementary kind of artificial light. We grow entirely under artificial light. So we control the intensity of the spectrum, all of the conditions in the farm. And the one kind of unique thing about Plenty is we have a pretty unique architecture.
Nate Storey:So we've gone out and we've taken the stacked beds or these horizontal flat surfaces of the greenhouse. We've flipped them on their side, put them back to back, and increased the amount of growing space that we can pack into a square meter of floor plan. So we've kind of gone out and figured out how to condense all of this production into a teeny tiny space, control that space really, really closely, and to produce an incredible amount of products out of a relatively small volume.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:Yeah. We'll talk more about how you grow in a minute, because that's very unique to Plenty as opposed to some of the other companies. But how does Plenty improve food security, safety, and availability?
Nate Storey:Yeah. I think there's a lot of different lenses to answer that question at a very local or consumer level. Our food today travels very long distances. And it's reliant on things like cold chain, both for supply and for safety, it depends on fields that are under pressure, right? Environmental pressure, smoke, drought, you name it. It's getting harder to grow. It's getting harder and harder to grow every year. And that's not going to change, right?
Nate Storey:And so at the consumer level we can think about it as a guaranteed supply that you know is safe, it's produced the exact same way at the exact same place, every single time. You may be come up a level from the consumer level to the supplier level and you start to think about, well, what can indoor farming be to a mature industry, right/ A mature industry that's growing at maximum capacity.
Nate Storey:There's not a whole lot of land left to go out and get and yet demand is growing, right? So how do we grow our agricultural capacity as producers in order to meet the demands of consumers? And how do you do that in a way that's predictable, that's safe, that allows us to scale, right/ Something that has historically kind of hit the limits of scale. And if we zoom out maybe one more level and we say, globally, what does it mean?
Nate Storey:I think we tend to think about whether a shelf is bear in local supermarket as kind of a local issue, but these are symptoms of a global problem, right? Shipping is disrupted. It's harder and harder to move things reliably around the world. COVID was a great example of that. We're dealing with the post-COVID, stimulus, ramping up demand before supply can match. And we couple that with all the craziness of the environmental pressures on the field globally.
Nate Storey:And we have a food security issue on our hands. And so we can view CEA or indoor farming [inaudible 00:06:53] global lens of saying, hey, listen, we're kind of a new form of real estate, if you want to think of it that way, we're a new way to grow the global capacity to produce without actually going out and really converting more landover, right? Or finding water, or finding a place that's sheltered from the elements.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:Yeah. It's fascinating. I was listening to a podcast this morning, really talking about the scope and the hugeness of our supply chain issue and how this whole idea that you and I have kind of grown up in business with just in time where something comes from China and it's ready and you don't have any backup and all the problems we're having our supply chain right now that are going to continue. And so when you think about it, you think about, okay, that comes down to our food. And your suggesting let's just grow this in a whole different way so that it's close by, and people can get it where they are, there's no shipping containers and fewer trucks. And that just makes a lot more sense of having food available to people.
Nate Storey:Yeah, that's right. I think that the answer, too, is like, where are we going to do it otherwise? Right?
Vonnie Estes, PMA:Yeah.
Nate Storey:Where are we going to do it otherwise? All the land that we can use is currently being used for this type of production. And we have to be honest about that. I think everyone in ag kind of knows that folks outside of ag. Folks outside of ag don't understand that, right? They're like, there are fields right next to my house, right? And in upstate New York or whatever. And you're like, yeah, but space does not a profitable field make. Right? And so walking people through the fundamentals of the industry and helping them understand what needs to be true in order to actually grow and make money and have reliable production year on year, that is a very different problem.
Nate Storey:That's more of like a cultural educational problem, right? People don't understand the threat that the field is under. They don't understand what farmers have to deal with these days. Because they have this very abstract, romantic idea of what production and farming looks like.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:Yeah. I think that's true. And I think with so many things changing right now with climate change and the water issues that we're having, especially here in California, and so you have to think about the forces on us and then supply chain, like we were saying, that things are changing. The forces on us are different. And so we have to respond in a different way and grow in a different way. And it doesn't mean outdoor growing is going away, but how are we going to make sure that people have the food that they need, when they need it, that's healthy and safe? And so this is an avenue to go down for sure.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:So you've talked about all the good things about it. Tell us some of the challenges of indoor growing? And as vertical farms become more a part of the food that we eat, there's certainly things that people say like, you use too much energy and there's a lot of complaints about it. What are the challenges and how's the industry coping with solving those problems?
Nate Storey:Yeah. That's a great question. There are a lot of challenges. It's in mass [inaudible 00:09:58]and industry, right? It's an industry with a lot of technology inputs. And that's both a challenge, as well as an opportunity. On the challenge side, integrating all of these different technology inputs into the business, making it all work together. That's really hard to do. You need a lot of engineers, you need a lot of plant scientists, you need a lot of folks that really know their business, right? To do this integration work. To take that integration and spin it into something even bigger, right? To basically become your own technology cost curve takes even more work. But what's necessary to make this industry go, right?
Nate Storey:So a lot of folks will look at into our ag and... This is at the heart of the issue, because people look at indoor ag and be like, it's too expensive. Well, not necessarily. You have to know what too expensive means, right. If you're saying it's too expensive in comparison to the field, then yeah, that's a comparison that, without understanding the industry, people look at it and be like, yeah, it makes no sense. I can go buy an acre of land in Salinas for $70,000 or whatever the outrageous per acre price for prime farmland is now. I can go buy that land for $70,000. We're talking like tens of millions of dollars to build the farm.
Nate Storey:And what people don't realize is what you're buying is a pretty massive amount of capacity. So like if we did an acreage to acreage comparison, we're matching the field in terms of the amount of profit that can be generated per dollar of input. Right?
Nate Storey:I think the other thing to understand is that technology integration, work really, really hard, but unlocks improvement at a rate that's unprecedented in agriculture, right? So I'm talking about the opportunity, but that comes at a cost, right? That is hard work to do. In Plenty today, we've spent a lot of on that R&D work to build that cost curve. And what it's doing is it's steadily here on your driving costs out of the system at a rate that, if you're a field producer, is unimaginable, right? Because we don't have cost curves in ag. We don't get the pleasure of cost curves. Facebook does, Google does, Tesla does, other tech industries do. But in agriculture, we haven't gotten to enjoy those very often.
Nate Storey:So what we're doing here is we're building our own cost curves. So that is hard. That is hard work. Getting the markets to understand this, right? Like, we are not a snapshot, we are a trend line as a business. The entire industry is not a snapshot. It is a trend line. And it's like a bunch of naysayers today will say like, well, it's still too expensive. It's still too hard. it's all these things. You're like, well, it was three times as expensive two years ago, and it was twice as hard. And we've cut our costs by 60%, right? And we're going to chop it by another 60% over the next two years, and another 60% over the year... And you can follow that line out and you realize, holy smokes, this goes to a completely different place than where we're at today.
Nate Storey:So getting the capital markets to understand this, because this is like any other agricultural asset-intensive industry, CapEx intensive one, and getting... I think consumer acceptance has been pretty easy, pretty rosy, people are excited about the idea of clean food. But it's really just kind of waking up the capital markets, helping them understand the problem, and then helping, just culturally, people understand why we have a problem in the first place. Right? And all of that is a challenge.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:Yeah. I think it's interesting you compare it to ag markets, but ag market... I mean, a lot of the ag markets, you don't have the type of fast change and new technology and driving that cost curve down. That doesn't happen in outdoor growing.
Nate Storey:That's right.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:So you're both a food ag company and a tech company, and trying to talk to investors and trying to talk to the market about, we are driving costs out and this is continuous improvement because we're learning more and more, and we're also an ag company. I'm sure that those conversations are kind of confounding sometimes.
Nate Storey:Yeah. They're hard and food. And ag haven't historically gone together, even a lot of the modern food companies are not really tech companies. Right? So you look at... And they may have some technology element. There may be some genetic technology, right? Some type of modification to produce Herman soybeans or what have you. Right? But they tend to be these linchpin elements of the system of the business. Right?
Nate Storey:And when you look at like the Plenty tech stack, we have dozens and dozens of patent families across dozens of different technology input areas. Right? And so you just have to walk a very fine line. And it's very hard to balance the very traditional incremental approach to producing safe, healthy food with the go-hand over fist as quickly as you can build, build, build faster, faster, faster. So those are not always complimentary ways of thinking about the world. So that's a tough line to walk and it's a tough tension to manage.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:The other thing that's interesting about the type of work that you guys do is, because of your control of the environment, you're really able to look at some improvements that are harder to do outside. And so when you look at all the changes that you're making and all the technology that you're using and thinking about, okay, can we use different light to get higher nutrition profiles? And can we use a different way of growing to get better flavor? And so I think you're able... What's coming along with all this is kind of different food, too. I mean, great, highly nutritious, wonderful food, but it's giving people different options which is really exciting as well.
Nate Storey:That's right. Yeah. We have the opportunity to kick open the doors to new flavors and new experiences that people don't usually get. Right? And I think that that's really exciting. Like we can talk all day about what it looks to just like scale the field endlessly, right? Through indoor ag. And I think that that's exciting, right? From a traditional agronomist viewpoint. Scaling the field endlessly is exciting. It unlocks incredible things that haven't been unlocked for a very long time for humanity. Like you think about going from hunter gatherers to the first agricultural societies. That was a step function leap forward. Right?
Vonnie Estes, PMA:Mm-hmm (affirmative).
Nate Storey:Then we think about like the Haber-Bosch process, or kind of Borlaug shuttle breeding, or these different points in time where humanity kind of just jumped forward on the agricultural production scale. Those are very exciting in and of themselves. I do think that we're looking at one of the first times here where we have, not just the opportunity to leap forward on the matter of scale, but also to leap forward in terms of quality, right? And experience, and being able to do some really weird stuff that people wouldn't otherwise get outside of their grandma's garden plot. Right? Outside of these very niche production. If you want to think about it as like a niche production facility, like your garden plot is a niche production facility. You're producing hand-selected cultivars, hand-selected varieties for your personal consumption in ways that a field producer just couldn't do it. It's not possible. Greenhouse grower can't do it.
Nate Storey:And that results in product that tastes different, people enjoy it very differently, they consume it differently. And I think indoor ag has an opportunity to come along and access some of the joy that comes from those niche production facilities or plots or whatever you want to call them and make it widely available. Right? And I think in an urbanized world, in a world where most people live in cities and they don't get to eat that kind of food very often, that's also a pretty exciting thing.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:Yeah. So for people who haven't really been inside and thought about how does a vertical farm work, can you take us through at a high-level operationally, kind of from seed to packing in the truck to go to the retail? Does it all happen there or does it...? How are things moving around inside of your production facility?
Nate Storey:Yeah. I mean, it all happens in the facility. There are no weird processes, right? There are no processes that are unfamiliar to anyone in production. We bring seed in, it's all ordered by lot, and we scan it in, we do checks to see what our vigor is. We check for disease pathogens, that kind of thing. It passes. It goes in. We plant it by a lot. We keep track of each lot, each tray that each lot goes into or-
Vonnie Estes, PMA:You use robotics for planting?
Nate Storey:Yeah, we do. The planting's all automated. The Compton Farm is an example. Almost all of the processes automated in Compton. I think that's another interesting thing about indoor ag, right? It is easier to automate some processes than in the field. We've got this big, distributed production environment. Indoors, we can automate things much less expensively. I know that sounds weird, but it's really true, right? You're condensing your automation intensity into a smaller space. So yeah, we-
Vonnie Estes, PMA:You're also not dealing with a hundred degree days and pouring rain and when and mud for it to get stuck in?
Nate Storey:That's exactly right. I look at these guys who are building strawberry pickers and I feel so sorry for them. That is a really hard problem to solve.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:[crosstalk 00:20:00].
Nate Storey:I've got it easy, right? I have it so easy in comparison to the folks that have to figure it out how to ruggedize this robot to go drive through a field for 24 hours a day, for months on end, picking. That is a really hard problem. And it's just because weird stuff is going to happen, right? Birds are going to land on your machine and poop on it. There's going to be grit blowing into all of your joints constantly. It's sandy. It's wet. You name the worst conditions you can imagine. And it will experience those conditions.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:Mm-hmm (affirmative).
Nate Storey:And indoors, we just don't have those issues, right? So it becomes more of a pure robotics problem. Obviously, robotics wedded to great plant science and horticulture and understanding the crop. But it's less of this like, how do I just make my things survive The natural environment? Right? It's already in an artificial environment. It's controlled. It's clean. It's much easier to manage.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:So back to the process, so-
Nate Storey:Back to process.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:... So your plants.
Nate Storey:Yeah. So the seed, it goes in, we're tracking it the whole way. That's another great thing about indoor life. We know where every lot of seed goes. We know what every trade does over the course of its life. We know what towers that trade goes into. We know what clam shells that tower goes into, right? So we're able to kind of track the plans and measure the performance of the plants over time in ways that are pretty awesome. Give us a lot of interesting insights into the process itself.
Nate Storey:So we plant our seed. It goes into the germ chambers. It comes out and goes into seedling production. We'll grow out seedlings. And then we take a robot. We pull that plug out and we stick it into tower in these are big vertical two-sided towers. We stand those towers up, hang them on a conveyor line, and they move through a growth space with light, with a perfectly controlled environment, nice, big, wide, open rows.
Nate Storey:And those towers with those seedlings go in very, very tight, but as they move through the room and as the plants grow, the towers actually spread apart. So we spread those towers apart as the plants grow to make sure they're getting the optimal amount of light, air flow, all of the stuff that keeps photosynthesis and the growth of that plant at the maximum rate.
Nate Storey:So that's really all it is, right? Moves through the room. Comes out the other end. We grab it with a lay-down robot. We set the tower down and zip it right through a harvester and zip zap. It's through. The tower goes off. Gets cleaned and replanted all in one motion. And all of that product goes off on a conveyor line. It goes through a sorter, and it goes through a cooler, and do packaging. It goes right into clamshells.
Nate Storey:And so we hold those clamshells, we test all over lots. Right? So it goes into clamshells. And then it's positive release, it goes out onto the trucks and out into the world. So it's really kind of the same process that everyone else has from a plant growth standpoint. if you think about it from the plant's perspective, though, the plants just have the ideal growing day every day of the year, right? So there's not a day where they [crosstalk 00:23:05].
Vonnie Estes, PMA:They're always having their best day.
Nate Storey:That's exactly right. So your best growing day, when you see that relative growth rate just leap up on all of your plants in the field, we have the pleasure of that every single day. Right? And we can start to tweak things over time to give it perfect spectrum, perfect light, match the genetics with the environment. And it's amazing what you can get out as a result.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:Yeah. It's really interesting to hear about that, because it is all the same processes, but the fact that you have them under one roof is, in terms of traceability, and providence, and all the stuff that we're trying to do when we grow outside of knowing where everything is and where it goes and the different fail points that can happen when you're moving things from one point to another. You have so much control because it's all right in one place, right?
Nate Storey:Yeah. That's a risk and an opportunity, right? I mean, from a process standpoint.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:Yeah, you could have a total failure, I guess, in there.
Nate Storey:Yeah. Again, we are intensifying agriculture in a lot of ways, right? You think about it, we're growing plants fast, we're growing more of them in smaller spaces and pushing them through, right? And that's great in a lot of ways. It results in a really healthy plan, a really nutritious plan, a really delicious plant. But it also says, hey, if you really screw something up, if you lose power, if you mess this system up, then you've got a mess on your hands. Right?
Nate Storey:And so it really forces us to invest in redundant systems and engineering things that are more fail-proof, more resilient. And ultimately I think it takes us to a really great place as an industry, just in terms of controlling production and controlling supply, but it is both an interesting opportunity as well as a risk. Yeah.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:Yeah. So one of the things you've mentioned, and let's dive into this a little bit more, one of the big differentiators of Plenty are your vertical towers instead of growing in flatbeds, like you see pictures of a lot of the other vertical farms. Explain to us what those are, and what the advantages are, and kind of how you came to that conclusion to grow that way.
Nate Storey:Yeah. I think the... So the towers represent an architecture, an architectural choice that we've made as a business. And it dates back to my masters and my PhD work. And at the time I was looking at greenhouse production, I was originally interested in working in greenhouse production. The thing that got me started was thinking about our production metrics. So like you measure the productive capacity of the greenhouse on the square meters of productive plane, right? How many meters of growing plane? What's the square footage of your greenhouse, right? That's how you measure productivity, but all of the costs on a volumetric basis, right?
Nate Storey:So the size of your facility, the amount of covering on that facility, the amount of getting natural gas you burn to heat, the amount of lighting, all of this stuff tends to have a very volumetric way of being costed out. And so I thought, that feels like a weird mismatch, right? And that's what got me into my first research, which was like, how can we use space and volume more effectively in these growing environments? How can we build kind of photon traps, if you will? How can we use more of the light that's coming in and use it more effectively?
Nate Storey:And that very quickly led to a realization that transitioning to the vertical plane allows us to really increase the amount of productivity within any given space, within any given volume. Right? And so then it kind of led to this experiment of saying, well, what's the best way to organize plants in space? A very fundamentalist kind of view. We just assumed that we do-
Vonnie Estes, PMA:You have to forget everything, though, to even ask that question, right?
Nate Storey:You have to forget everything, right? You have to say, how do we organize plants in space? How does nature organize plants in space? Why do plants grow the way plants grow? These are all very simple, fundamental questions that I don't think that many people, even in our ask. But it's all about light interception and management and space use. How can we organize plants in space to be most effective? And what I'd seen was folks were starting to tinker with the indoor production space, but everyone was doing these flat stacked beds.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:Mm-hmm (affirmative).
Nate Storey:And I started scratching my head because just thinking about spatial use, right? Like what's the spatial efficiency of this organization of plants and space? And when you did the numbers, you've got To have access aisles. You've got two layers to manage. Think about managing the environment as managing surfaces, right? Airflow past surfaces. Plants need CO2. You need to get rid of the O2, you need to get rid of the humidity, and you need to get rid of the heat, right? And all of these are generated in the process of growing plants doors.
Nate Storey:So if you start to think about it that way, now you've got to manage surfaces. One surface is productive, meaning you make money on the plants, but you don't make money on non-productive surfaces. So I started to think about these physics problems, if you will, and realized that this is a really inefficient way to do plant organization in space, right? This stocked-bed approach.
Nate Storey:Now it's not to me say it's bad and it to doesn't work, but very early on, people tended to mistake the ability to grow plants indoors with an actual profitable pathway, right? And what I realized was in order for the industry to go to where it needs to go, which is ultimately to be on price parity with the field, we needed to rethink how we organize plants in space.
Nate Storey:So that's where that started. And I started playing with towers and then I realized, oh, lighting reception efficiency is a major problem in the industry. Meaning plants have to be spaced to their mature spacing very early on. Meaning most of the photons that you're dumping into the space just land on non-synthetic surfaces, right?. They just bounce off. They turn to heat. They increase your cost. It's a negative feedback.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:Yeah. Yeah.
Nate Storey:Right? And so, really, the fundamental premise became, okay, in a stacked-rack system, your productivity is roughly equivalent to LED efficiency improvements year-on-year. Right? That ends up being the fundamental whole rate predictor, I guess, for yield gain in stock systems. But if we can break that dependency, now we can build systems that are productive enough to get us to price parity with the field.
Nate Storey:And so that was kind of what led to this idea of towers, but towers that spread apart, right? So it is like a lot of the European greenhouse growers do this already. These are the indexing gutter systems you see in Europe. And we basically took that concept, which is a fabulous concept. And some brilliant people back in like the seventies in Finland, in Denmark were pioneering these moving-gutter techniques. And we took that principle and we stood it up, right? And we just said, how do we do moving-gutters vertically? Growing on both sides of the gutter. All of the lights in the center, back to back. Air distribution in the center. And gives us convective cooling. Gives us a lot of airspace to manage, really carefully, our temperature, humidity, VPD, and CO2, and all these other variables.
Nate Storey:So that's kind of what led us to the vertical tower architecture. But as you can imagine, building a new architecture is expensive and hard. We looked at it really hard and we said, listen, this is something that's way more productive per square meter. Double to triple what a sack producer can grow on square meter of floor plan basis. Right? It unlocks the door to more yield per square meter. So when we're thinking about a square meter of growing plane, unlocks new yields, right? So if you think about the field, the field for lettuce is at six grams per square meter per day. Okay? That's roughly what a field will produce in terms of saleable output, right?
Vonnie Estes, PMA:Mm-hmm (affirmative).
Nate Storey:And that's for head lettuce. So it's not a perfect comparison, but it's as close as we can get. You look at a greenhouse and you're at like 75 to 150, depending on how intensive that greenhouse is, how moderate it, how well-managed it is. Like the moving-gutter systems of Europe, incredible systems, incredible people. And they're pushing the limit. They're probably like 150 grams per square meter per day for a baby crop, a smaller crop. You go to the other indoor producers and they tend to be in the 200, maybe 300 grams per square per day. And this is growing plane, again not floor plan, but growing plane. And you look at Plenty and we're over 900.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:Oh my gosh.
Nate Storey:So with our baby products, we're over 900 today. And our targets are around two kilograms, right? Two kilograms of field per square meter of growing plane on a daily basis, 24-hour period. And that's saleable biomass. That's not stems, that's not roots, that's not all the other stuff. But that speaks to the fact that this architecture unlocks yield. It also unlocks new crops. So that's the other thing that I looked at in the space, like how do we grow as many different things as possible on the same platform? How do we build a platform as opposed to just building a farm and then happening to build an entirely new kind of farm to grow tomatoes, to grow strawberries, to grow eggplant, to grow peppers, to grow all the other things that we want to grow?
Nate Storey:So yeah, at the end of the day, this is an expensive, hard thing to do, but it unlocks yield in ways that no one else can touch. Because, again, they have the heat problem, right? Their yield rate is limited by the LED efficiency improvement rate. So we're decoupled from that. That's not our problem. Our problem becomes perfection, perfection, perfection. How do we deliver better and better conditions and match those better conditions with better and better genetics?
Vonnie Estes, PMA:So how many versions have you done of the tower?
Nate Storey:Lots of versions of the tower.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:I would bet.
Nate Storey:And there will be more versions to come.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:That's amazing. Yeah, because it's such a different idea. And so you started that when you were in school and you took that into your first company that then became Plenty as well. Is that how that progressed?
Nate Storey:Yeah, that's right. Took it in my first company and built kind of a farm technology, farm sales business called [Brad Echo Tech 00:33:49], and then folded that into Plenty few years later. Yeah.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:Wow. That's great. So what crops do you grow now? And what crops are you working on? You're talking about building a platform to be able to grow different things. So where are you now and what are you expanding to?
Nate Storey:Yeah. Today we're mostly focused on greens and herbs. Right? And I think a lot of folks in the space dove into greens and herbs because they thought, primary growth, super easy, like-
Vonnie Estes, PMA:Eat everything. Yeah.
Nate Storey:Yeah. Everyone eats a salad, right? And I think the irony is that as we've gone deeper on it, greens are easier to optimize, but Gs from a process intensity standpoint, greens are maybe the hardest crop you can grow.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:Huh?
Nate Storey:And so it's ironic that... We did it, too. Everyone in the industry thought primary production, super efficient growth, LEDs are expensive, light is expensive, this is how we do it. Right? And now years later I'm kind of like, oh man, I wish we'd start it with strawberries or tomatoes.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:Those greenhouse growers were thinking something good with those tomatoes.
Nate Storey:Yeah. Yeah. Wisdom, right? Wisdom. So anyways, we're focused on greens and herbs today in terms of our actual commercial production. That being said, we've been breeding tomatoes for a couple years and we've got some insanely productive tomato systems. Think thousands of kilograms per square meter per year of floor plan as opposed to, say 45 for something like cherry tomatoes, two's of magnitude yield gain. One order of magnitude, you've got a great business, two orders of magnitude and it's like, holy smokes, this is going to be game-changing. Strawberries, we've been working on strawberries.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:Mm-hmm (affirmative).
Nate Storey:And I think as we look to the future and the future farms, we'll be building farming campuses, right? Where we have greens, tomatoes, strawberries, and then probably a host of additional crops that we bring along. The cool thing about tomatoes, strawberries, and greens is it's kind of, think of it as kind of a book-ending exercise, right. In between greens and in between strawberries, we have almost all of the equipment now integrated into the platform to grow almost any other horticulture crop we want.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:Oh, right. Yeah, that's true.
Nate Storey:So almost everything. Those two covered the two far extremes of the spectrum from a production standpoint. And it opens the doors to going very, very fast with new crops after that.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:What's the criteria that you think about now that you've had the experience with greens and you know it's not as easy as everyone thought? And then strawberries and tomatoes, certainly huge markets for those. And especially getting strawberries and tomatoes year round that taste really good, that's huge. In between there, what's your criteria? How do you think about what you would pick next?
Nate Storey:There are obviously market considerations, what do people want to eat?
Vonnie Estes, PMA:Yeah.
Nate Storey:I think that's a great first layer. We tend to think about that first layer as like the hero crops of the grocery aisle. Right?
Vonnie Estes, PMA:Yeah. [crosstalk 00:37:14].
Nate Storey:So the top performers in the grocery aisle, the real draws tend to be the berries, strawberries, blueberry, blackberry, raspberry tend to be right after that tomatoes. And then after that, greens. And in all of those categories, berries already embody it. But in all of those categories, consumers are moving more towards like snackability, convenience, simplicity. Right? So that's always like a good, I think first principle of human behavior, like, where are people going? Let's meet them there.
Nate Storey:The next way is more on the science side. We say, is this crop appropriate for the system and for the things that we have today, or is it appropriate for the things that we'll have later, tomorrow, next year, 10 years from now? And then where on that timeline does it land? And the easiest way to explain that is, what's the cost of the carbon and the product, right? If we just want to get really fundamental. How much does it cost to fix the carbon? And then how much of that carbon can we sell in the product? What's the value of the carbon that we're selling? Right.
Nate Storey:So that's kind of the fundamental calculation. But I will say that, I think on the science side, we tend to focus on a few, very fundamental things. Can we achieve the growth with habit that we want? The harvesting, training, pruning, all of the other human management inputs, can we minimize those with breeding or with hardware that's cleverly designed? And then what's the saturation point of this particular crop? How plastic is it? How easy is it to work with? Right? Tomatoes, easy to breed, so easy in comparison to other crops. So why wouldn't we? Right?
Vonnie Estes, PMA:Yeah.
Nate Storey:And potential for very high saturation points. Meaning if you think about these things as energy systems, right? The indoor farm is just an energy system. It's like a battery, right? It's like a car. It's like grid. It's like any energy system in the world. You put energy into it, you get energy out of it. A different form of energy. And all you're doing is trying to minimize the amount of inefficiency along the way.
Nate Storey:So we put X number of kilowatts in, we get X number of kilowatts out. We lost so many to heat, to this, to that along the way. And with these systems, if you think about them that way, then the more energy that you can put in to the same size system, the better, right? It's like it's throughput. It's industrial throughput. Think of it as bottling plant. If you can run your bottling plant twice as fast as the guy next door, you can win.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:Mm-hmm (affirmative).
Nate Storey:And that's really what we're focused on. How do we run our bottling plant faster and faster and faster. Going back to that first principle, how do we divorce ourselves from the energy efficiency curve of LEDs? How do we put more light into the space? How do we not worry about heat and humidity and all the negative things that come with it?
Nate Storey:So yeah, we've just built a really fantastic energy system. And a core component to that energy system is the plant. How do you build a plant that saturates at really high levels, that you can just pump the energy into and get an acceptable amount of energy out of?
Vonnie Estes, PMA:Given that there's so much you can do with the environment around growing plants in indoor ag, how important is breeding to your programs? I know you've got the program with Driscoll's, and they're excellent in breeding, but in some of these other crops, do you think about breeding and are you doing your own or working with partners? How's that going?
Nate Storey:Yeah. For most crops, breeding doesn't matter. And unfortunately, in the industry, most folks, especially like the seed companies and the breeders that are going after things, they don't know what doesn't matter yet, because they're not doing the work. Some crops, it does matter. But the other kind of sad thing is, for the crops that it does matter for, it's highly dependent on your system architecture, right?
Nate Storey:So the kind of tomatoes that I'm growing, someone growing in rafts and a stacked bed system would probably not want to grow. They probably will have to rebuild their system from the ground up with a completely different approach to production. Right? So it kind of means there's a lot of targets out there, trait targets.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:Mm-hmm (affirmative).
Nate Storey:So if you're a breeder thinking, I'm going to jump into the indoor space and make a killing, I would say, wait for 10 years.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:That's probably good advice. Yeah.
Nate Storey:Because you don't know what matters yet, right? It's like, what are your targets? What are your targets? And no one can tell me what their targets are. So until someone can tell me what their targets are, I think genetics is best left in the hands of the producers themselves. I think there is a really interesting opportunity to reset the value chain dynamics with indoor farming. Meaning, in the field, the farmers get squeezed. That's just all there is to it.
Nate Storey:I got into this because I got tired of seeing farmers get squeezed. And I think with indoor ag, there's an opportunity for the farmers not to be squeezed. We've got a head start on a lot of the folks that occupy other positions in the value chain. Now, I think there's an opportunity for farmers to own more of that value chain as we look to the future, or minimally to balance the value chain better so that it isn't just one party getting squeezed by parties on either side of them, it ends up being everyone shares the risk equally, right? And we've got a more efficient and more equitable food system from an engagement standpoint. Right?
Nate Storey:So all of that to say some crops, breeding is really important. But I think for, probably the next decade, those breeding targets are going to be extremely specific to the producer. And I think that that means, ultimately, most of the breeding companies can't afford to play meaningfully for 10 years. Because even some of the fastest growers, there's some great folks in the space doing some incredible work, building a lot of farms really fast, but even the farms that the fastest growers are going to build are going to be a drop in the bucket in comparison to larger industry.
Nate Storey:So if you think maybe there's an opportunity for a more equitable risk distribution in the value chain, and also it will take a long time for the total market share to be meaningful, that's a little less exciting, I think, for most breeders, at least the way they've done breeding in the past.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:Well, it's interesting, I think, to your point of just waiting to see how far can environmental input take us. And you're still figuring that out, like just working with light and all the other things that you're working with, you're just still figuring out how far can we push this from the environment. And I think as we move further along and understanding that, and then understanding what the targets are, then there may be a way to work together that gets to traits that are more valuable. But still, I think, as you said, it's going to be more producer-specific because what you need is going to be different than what someone else needs.
Nate Storey:That's right.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:Yeah. That's interesting.
Nate Storey:And to a degree, it becomes marketing intelligence, right? I see some of these companies that are working with breeders and I know some of the terms of those collaboration agreements. And the instate is that grower pays a lot of money to the seed company for seed for the rest of their lives. That's the outcome.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:Yeah. That's true.
Nate Storey:It's kind of like, come on, guys, play hard to get here. Don't give away the value of your market intelligence that easily.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:Yeah, that's true. Hey, one last question. Last time we talked, it's been a while, Compton was just getting going, what's happening with Compton now and where are we in that whole project?
Nate Storey:Compton's going well. It is a big complex thing to build. And this is our first time building anything this big and complex. So yeah, we're learning a lot. It's coming along. And we'll be excited to be putting food out into the world from that Compton facility next year.

Vonnie Estas, PMA:Welcome to PMA takes on tech, the podcast that explores the problems, solutions, people, and ideas that are shaping the future of the produce industry. I'm your host Vonnie Estas, Vice President of Technology for the produce marketing association, and I've spent years in the ag tech sector. So I can attest, it's hard to navigate this ever-changing world in developing and adopting new solutions to industry problems. Thanks for joining us and for allowing us to serve as your guide to the new world of produce and technology. My goal of the podcast is to outline a problem in the produce industry and then discuss several possible solutions that can be deployed today.
Vonnie Estas, PMA:Special thanks to PMA member Crop Track for their sponsorship of this season of PMA takes on tech. Crop tracks cloud platform helps companies bring their supply chain to new levels, enabling real time visibility throughout the organization. One technology platform for the entire raw supply chain. Go to croptrack.com/PMA to track what matters today and into the future.
Vonnie Estas, PMA:Today, we have a very special guest, Jack Bobo. He's a food futurist and author of the new fascinating book, 'Why Smart People Make Bad Food Choices'. Jack has the exact background you would want and expect in a food futurist, 13 years at the U.S. Department of state, which I think is where we met. I think we met there around 2014 when I was working in some biotech issues. So he's steeped in global food policy and then he spent close to four years at Intrexon. So he steeped in commercialization of new technologies, and what that role can bring. He sits on a number of boards along with his current company and does a ton of speaking and wrote the book. So you're a very busy guy. Welcome to the podcast.
Jack Bobo:I'm delighted to be here. Thanks for having me on.
Vonnie Estas, PMA:So why don't you tell us a little bit about what you're doing now and the type of clients you work with and kind of the value that you bring to the conversations with the companies that you're working with?
Jack Bobo:Sure. So I started my consulting firm about two and a half years ago. Futurity. Sounds like a made up word, but it's not. And I thought that I'd spend a lot of time talking about communication and policy and regulation, things that I'd worked on for a long time. But what I really ran into is that a lot of organizations, a lot of companies, there's a lot of angst out there about what the future of food is and how businesses and products and brands fit into that future. And so I think I ended up doing a lot of therapy and, you know, that sort of the futurist aspect of it came in because it's trying to help organizations to think about, you know, what is the future they want, not just the future they're going to get.
Jack Bobo:And so, you know, I tell people that I work with few tech startups, big food brands, helping them understand what does the future of food look like, where consumer trends and attitudes are going and how do organizations get ahead of trends, so don't get run over by them. And it's really about trying to look around corners, to look at the trends that other people are talking about. But to then think about what are the forces that are shaping those trends because that's how you get ahead of them. You figure out where it's going and then you position yourself there. And so that's been a lot of fun working with, you know, all the different parts of the food industry in order to think about how do we create a sustainable and nutritious future for all.
Vonnie Estas, PMA:So when you engage with your different kinds of clients, like who is the person that says, we need to talk to that guy. Cause that's someone who is very future focused and thinking about how do we get ahead? And I imagine that's not, you know, it's not just any person in the organization. Does it tend to be the CEOs or what type of people call you up and say, you need to come in and talk to my team?
Jack Bobo:Yeah. So with the larger food companies, it's a lot of the executives. You know, I, as you mentioned, I spent 13 years at state department and at the time I used to say that big companies are a lot like children; they only call when there's a problem. And I had the opportunity to work with lots of companies to try to solve their problems. So I have, you know, pretty enormous network of organizations and people that have risen to the top of the organizations that they now work for.
Jack Bobo:But then on the other hand, you've got a lot of these food tech companies and sometimes I just reach out to them. I see how they're messaging, and I think, oh my God, you know, they're going to run into problems. I'm going to see if I can fix that. And fortunately, I also have a network who can make introductions in that happen, but often I get calls from venture capitalists who have companies in their portfolio, and they're like, could you please talk to the CEO of this new startup and, you know, keep help them to communicate in a way that doesn't antagonize where the traditional agriculture industry, while being true and authentic to who they are.
Vonnie Estas, PMA:That's so great. We'll dig into that a little bit more in a minute, but I want to talk a little bit about your book. So what made you decide to write it? How long did it take and how's it being received?
Jack Bobo:So the book, 'Why Smart People Make Bad Food Choices', and it's not what I think about bad food choices. It's, you know, to help people who feel like they themselves are not making the choices that they want to be making for themselves. So I'm not passing judgment on other people. I'm not a dietician. You know, I'm not a doctor. It's about helping people to make the decisions that they want to make for their own health. And I spent about a year working on it.
Jack Bobo:The first six months, I actually was writing a series of blog posts and those 10 initial posts are still up on my website, looking at consumer psychology. And I was really interested in like how the ways that our brains sometimes lead us to make bad choices and to help people recognize that. And then as I decided to turn it into a book, I realized that sort of the first third is the mind leading us astray.
Jack Bobo:But then there's also our food environment that is also leading us to make these bad choices. And then the last part of the book is what would it take to redesign our food environment? So healthy outcomes where the default. And one of the things that really struck me when I started with the project was how can it be at a time when we've never known more about health and nutrition in the history of the planet, and we've never been more obese? We've never had more healthy food choices and options in a grocery store, and yet we've never been more obese. So it's not as if people in 1960 had a greater willpower than we have today. I mean, they were cooking with Crisco, need more lard? Yeah. Let's pour it on there.
Jack Bobo:Somehow very few people were obese in 1960, 42% of Americans are obese today. 75% are overweight or obese and we're going to 50% by 2030, so just in another decade. So if we don't really seriously change the direction of society, you know, we're going to be entering a period in which every generation lives less and doesn't live as long as the generation before. And you know, that's never been the case. And so, you know, so that's what the book is hoping to tackle is helping us to think about that food scape in a way that's very different than how a diet book would approach the problem.
Vonnie Estas, PMA:So I know it took a whole book to explain all this, but give some examples or just some things that were surprising to you as far as like, what are those changes? Why is it different now than 1960? What kind of happened in the evolution of how we interact with our food?
Jack Bobo:So, you know, I have one chapter on decision fatigue or mental fatigue, and, you know, we're all familiar with the idea that you shouldn't go grocery shopping when you're tired and that's because when you're mentally tired, you just don't make as good a choice. And when you have to make more choices in a row, the choice, the ability to make good choices gets worse and worse. And so, is there any place in our environment in which we have to make more choices than in a grocery store? And so you ask what's changed. Well, you know, there are tens of thousands more products in a grocery store today than there were in 1980. So if you think about it, you know, in 1980, you went to the grocery store and you had two choices for a pasta sauce. You could get Prego or Ragu or Ragu and Prego, and that was it.
Jack Bobo:But a decade later you had chunky and spicy and meat sauce. And you know...
Vonnie Estas, PMA:And some are low fat, and some are high this and low that, and yeah.
Jack Bobo:Right. And just dozens and dozens of choices. And it was the same with salad dressings, barbecue sauce, and all these things. And having choice improves happiness up to a point, but then it begins to actually erode that happiness because then you begin to wonder whether you've made the right choice. And so what is sort of intended to make us happier and enjoy our lives more, can have negative consequences. And so then there's another chapter of the book in which I talk about something called the halo effect, which is just when a product has one positive attribute, we just assume it has more. And you know, this is actually with the plant based burger movement that 95% of people are buying them because they think it's healthier.
Jack Bobo:When, of course, you know, they're no more nutritious and in some respects, less nutritious, than a conventional burger. Now the people producing it are doing it primarily for ethical and environmental reasons, but there's a mismatch between why people are buying it and what it's delivering. And so the halo effect really arose, again, back in the 19 early 1980s when the dietary guidelines first came along. And one of the things that they recommended was lower fat diets.
Jack Bobo:Well, that makes a lot of sense. You know, heart disease was a big contributor to illness and food companies did what we would want them to do. They started offering low fat options, you know, for the products they normally produce, but then the halo effect kicked in and people thought, well, if one low fat cookie is good for me and entire bag must be great. The low fat and low calorie are not the same thing at all.
Vonnie Estas, PMA:Exactly.
Jack Bobo:So all of these things that were sort of intended to allow us to sort of lead a healthier life, in many respects, have actually moved us in the other direction. And then that's the psychology of it. But then there are a lot of examples of the book of the environment. You know, we're all familiar with, you know, supersized portions today. But what most of us don't realize is that it all leads back to the mad genius of one man, back in the 1960s, David Wallerstein. And he was working for a chain of movie theaters and his job was to figure out how to get people to eat more popcorn. And so he tried two for one deals and all sorts of things to get them to come back, and people just would not go back and buy a second bag of popcorn. And all of a sudden it hit him.
Jack Bobo:Well, what if the reason they don't want more popcorn is they're embarrassed. You know, people might think I'm gluttenous if I go and have two bags of popcorn. And so it hit him well, what if I offered to a bigger bag? And up until that point, food companies never offered larger portions because they saw it as a way of discounting and they thought it undermined their brand value by doing it. So there was a reason they didn't do it, but of course, you know, then the rest is history. Once he did it, soft drink sales took off everything in the concession stand grew. Well, he would work for McDonald's and he convinced Ray Crock that they needed to offer larger sizes than McDonald's, which also took Ray Crock a long time to acknowledge because these like, they'll go back for a second bag. Well, that's just not true.
Jack Bobo:And it wasn't until 1972, that they finally introduced the large McDonald's fry. And you know, that really began to, you know, the steam roll all of this. But there's stories in the book about those sorts of things. Most of us today don't even know what an adult serving of food looks like because if you were to buy a happy meal, well, a small kid's fry is a large fry from 1972.
Vonnie Estas, PMA:Oh, wow.
Jack Bobo:A 12 ounce soda, well, that's 50% larger than the seven or eight ounce soda you would have gotten as an adult in 1955. And so in the burger is bigger as well. So we don't even know, it's just not even in our conception, what an adult serving used to be. And, you know, that's part of the challenges that we don't even know how much we're supposed to eat or what would be normal because we eat our foods so quickly that our body doesn't have an opportunity to let us know that it's full. And so every meal we're eating 20 or 30% more calories than we actually need in order to satisfy us. And so you do that every day for 30 years, and that's when you get where we are.
Vonnie Estas, PMA:That's exactly right. And I remember one thing you said in the book was talking about the plate size at a restaurant. So they're putting more food on a larger plate. So it doesn't, if you put that on a regular dinner plate, you would think, oh my gosh, that's so much more than I would eat at home. But if you put it on a big plate, then it's fine.
Jack Bobo:Right. And we reward restaurants though, that give us lots of food. You know, it's like, it seems like a good value, but if you less happy, less healthy and less wealthy, maybe it's not such a great deal.
Vonnie Estas, PMA:Exactly. I was reading an article last year, so, and I think it was put out by someone at Google. And Google's done a lot of work on trying to figure out how to get their workforce to eat healthier because they want to keep them there for three meals a day. I mean, that's behind their madness, but they do want to keep them and they see the value of keeping them healthy, insurance premiums and that sort of thing. But one of the things that they were talking about was kind of the psychology around meetings, foods at meetings. And, and I've always complained about this because I'm not, I would much rather eat fruit and vegetables than eat a donut.
Vonnie Estas, PMA:But if I'm so fatigued in a meeting and there's a break and there's a big chocolate chip cookie, that's like, you know, two inches away from my hand, I'm probably going to eat it. You know, where I would never eat that normally. So they were talking about different ways of like setting snacks outside the room or having healthier snacks, or how have you seen some of the people that are trying to figure out how do we change this behavior in people?
Jack Bobo:Yeah. And there's an entire chapter in the book about the work that Google's doing. So I talked to Michael Barker who led that initiative, and Javan Hanson who's now running it right now. And we don't think of Google when we're talking about food normally, but what they've done is they've crunched the data on the 200,000 people they were feeding one, two or three meals a day before COVID came along and, you know, they did what they did best. They crunched all that data. And then they used it to figure out what could they do in order to nudge people to healthier food choices. And there are a lot of things that can be done. One of the things they did was they took the sodas, which were free, but they put them behind frosted glass in a lower refrigerator, so it wasn't as easily accessible.
Jack Bobo:They took the snack station and they moved it just a little bit further away from the coffee station, because what people were doing was they were getting a cup of coffee and while it was brewing, they would just, you know, go three or four feet away and grab a snack. Well you put it 15 feet away, and all of a sudden you get a 60% reduction in snacking because nobody wants to leave their drink. And so, you know, redesigning the buffet lines, and changing the names of the servings, and working with the Culinary Institute of America to design new recipes for vegetables to make them amazing so that people wanted to eat the healthier food. So there's a lot that that company did. Compass Group is the company that, you know, does the food service for them, and they partnered with them.
Jack Bobo:And so Compass Group then takes the ideas that are being generated at Google, and they're taking it to the hospitals and corporate cafeterias and schools and other things where they operate. So a lot of those ideas are being widely distributed. There's work that's happening in the UK where the grocery retailers are redesigning the layout of the grocery store in order to nudge more fruit and vegetable purchases. I think they've gotten like 16% increases over the course of a year just by redesigning the layout of the shopping experience. And so consumers don't even know that those things are happening, you know, they just end up with more fruits and vegetables in their basket and, you know, they would have no way of being able to explain why they bought it. They would just say, oh, I just felt like it. Well, you felt like because you were kind of nudged along the way, you know, as you went through the aisles today.
Vonnie Estas, PMA:Interesting. So this podcast, I focus a lot on technology. So how can technology help us develop better foods and help people make healthier choices? I mean, you kind of have a background in biotech. And so what kinds of things do you think could happen that will help us have a healthier, healthier people?
Jack Bobo:Yeah. I mean, technology and innovation are playing a role at every step of the process. And, you know, helping us to tweak them and make them healthier. But they're also allowing us to use data and information ways that allow consumers to make more informed choices, to have better information. Often information, of course, doesn't lead to better outcomes because, you know, we often don't look for information that's going to help us. You know, if you put low fat or you put low sodium on a can of soup, people enjoy it less. Even if a blind taste test, it tastes exactly the same as the regular one. Once you add the low sodium people will actually respond and appreciate it less.
Vonnie Estas, PMA:Huh, they think something has been taken away from them.
Jack Bobo:Yeah. And if you were to do brain scans, I mean, there would actually be less enjoyment of that experience. So it's not that they're just telling you that they didn't like it, they actually experience it as less tasty.
Vonnie Estas, PMA:Huh.
Jack Bobo:And so that's why some companies are going to stealth health, where they're tweaking the recipes in order to make them healthier, but they're not actually advertising it. And, you know, I think, you know, that working with psychology. And I think when it comes to innovations, you need to figure out when can you lean into the technology and people love it, like their smartphone. And when do you not focus on the technology and let it sort of fall into the background? And, you know, my standard quote is people love innovation almost as much as they despise change. There's no place people despise change more though than the food they eat.
Jack Bobo:Because food is what brings us together with friends and family. And if you mess with my food, you're messing with my family and people just don't like that. But if we don't change how we produce food, everything will change. So, and consumers just don't know how much innovation was already there. We produce twice as much food as we did in 1960 on more or less the same amount of land. And without innovation, we would have had to cut down a billion hectors of forest.
Jack Bobo:And, you know, that would have a huge environmental impact. I mean, that's more than a quarter of all the forest left on the planet. And so innovation has played a critical role, but it often goes unnoticed. And one of the things that I find interesting is that consumers are much more accepting of innovation from startups than they are from big food companies. And so you see this all the time that, you know, innovations, you know, seem like they're only coming from the startups, but a lot of it's because that's where consumers want it to come from.
Vonnie Estas, PMA:Interesting.
Jack Bobo:And that goes to a lot of consumer psychology as well.
Vonnie Estas, PMA:Yeah. I think that's really fascinating. How do we balance the, you know, you were saying consumers don't really know, and they just want better products. And we certainly, you know, consumers don't buy technology, they buy products. But how do we kind of balance that with transparency? So if you know you and I both worked around GMOs some, and but if you look at some of the newer technologies like gene editing or epigenetics, or some of the non-GMO breeding, new breeding technologies, do consumers want to know, do they not want to know how do we talk about it? How do we bring on new products? Kind of what do you see happening there?
Jack Bobo:Yeah. So one thing you want to do is you want to be transparent before anybody's asking for transparency. So if you're responding to a request you've already lost. And McDonald's learned this lesson when some of the communication marketing people were pushing the company in order to put all of their ingredient lists on the website, and they finally caved and they said, fine, we'll put it all on there. And they did. And nobody visited the websit.,
Vonnie Estas, PMA:And it was there.
Jack Bobo:And the executives were like, what's going on? We spent all this time and money and energy doing this, and nobody cares. And the marketing guys were like, yes, that's the point. That people actually responded in surveys as being much more comfortable knowing the information was there, even though they never actually checked it out. And so, you know, transparency, you know, should be something that's sort of part of our everyday experience. And when it works well, it's totally irrelevant. And you know, think about transparency and where we are today. Like people do care about transparency, but eventually transparency becomes the norm in the same way.
Jack Bobo:A hundred years ago, people cared about food safety because food was not safe. But today food safety is the floor. Everybody must be safe. So it's not, you can't say, oh, I'm safe for the next guy and get business. Today transparency's a ceiling that we aspire to, but 10 years from now, it'll be the floor. So as an organization, you can get credit today by being more transparent than the next guy. 10 years from now, you will be punished if you are less transparent than the next guy. And so, you know, I would encourage organizations that if you could be transparent enough, sometimes those things that you feel like they're real problems, can just disappear.
Vonnie Estas, PMA:Yeah. One of the things that I've been working with some just within the organization is around gene editing. And so many companies not wanting to be the first because they're afraid that the, that people will go after them. And so the technology is not getting used in a lot of new breeding technologies. Aren't getting used because they're afraid to be transparent. But then they're afraid to not be transparent. And so I think we need that, you know, as we said, we need that product that people just love. And then, you know, you tell them how it was made. And they're like, great, I love it. That's what I'm going to eat. You know? So I think it's hard to get there.
Jack Bobo:Well, but think about, you know, what would have happened if the impossible burger, which is a GMO burger. Had been created by Monsanto?
Vonnie Estas, PMA:I shudder to think.
Jack Bobo:So, I think we know that it wouldn't have been successful, but every newspaper article in the world would have said it failed because nobody wants a GMO burger.
Vonnie Estas, PMA:Yeah.
Jack Bobo:And that's actually not true. But everybody would have assumed the failure was on the product, the technology, instead of the fact that nobody wants a GMO burger from that large multinational company. Whereas almost nobody cared that impossible burger was, you know, made with GMOs. And even though, you know, many organizations did, you know, highlight that fact, because at first it was only offered in high-end restaurants. And so rich people were perfectly happy to pay $20 a burger in order to have this GMO ultra processed product. Now the big pushback came when it went into 18,000 Burger Kings and all of a sudden poor people could afford it. And so, you know, there's that socio-economic change.
Vonnie Estas, PMA:so people who had money were fine, as long as it was special. I mean, why were they willing to pay for it? Okay.
Jack Bobo:Right. It was unique. It was exclusive. And, you know, we do this all the time with, you know, in society, you know, artisanal is just another word for saying something is poorly produced. You know, back in the early 19 hundreds, people wanted glasses that were made and factories because they didn't have bubbles and imperfections. Today we pay people to put imperfections into our products because it's more expensive to do it that way now. And so just understanding that psychology. So it's not just what product comes to market, but it's who brings it to market as well.
Vonnie Estas, PMA:Yeah. I think that's really true. I've heard you talk about sustainability. I wanted to touch on that a little bit and how that just the whole area of sustainability is choices and consequences. So it's not good and bad it's choices and consequences and being aware of what those are. Can you talk a little bit more about that and what consumers think and how we should kind of think about it in terms of policy and how agriculture works?
Jack Bobo:Sure. I mean, too often when I hear people talking about sustainability that they want to know, well, how do we define sustainability? And that implies that there is a sustainable agriculture out there that, you know, if we could define it, then we could describe it. But sustainability is not a destination; it's a journey. So we will never get to sustainable agriculture because agriculture today is wildly more sustainable than agriculture was 30 years ago. And it's wildly more sustainable. It will be wildly more sustainable 30 years from now than it is today. And so, you know, we shouldn't talk about it in those terms as if somebody is achieving it. And we need to change part of the conversation from telling farmers what they should do. And instead talking to them about what they could do, because nobody likes to be told what to do.
Jack Bobo:And it's also suggesting to them that they're doing something wrong and yet, they're so much wildly more productive and sustainable than they were 20 or 30 years ago. So you're not giving them any credit for where they've gotten to. You're just blaming them for where they're going to going to be. And so how we talk about this is really important and, you know, our farmers, the problem to be solved, or the solution to the problem.
Jack Bobo:And so we get into some of this problem with sustainability, because really consumers think of sustainability in terms of what I would call local sustainability, that if we can reduce the amount of fertilizer or insecticide and pesticide water and all of those inputs, then we have less of a local impact. And that's what they think sustainable looks like, you know, using fewer resources to produce food. But for many organizations, large multinational, agribusinesses, they think in terms of sustainable intensification. The more food I can squeeze out of a piece of land, the better it is because we don't have to cut down forest in Brazil and Indonesia and other places to do it.
Jack Bobo:But, you know, the reality is that when you intensively farm, there will generally be more impact locally. So global sustainability, which is what I'm describing here, has a higher local impact, but a lower global impact. And local sustainability has a lower local impact, but it has a higher global impact. And the U.S. And the EU are sort of moving down these two different paths. You know, the U.S., I was on a webinar this morning with Dr. Chabata Jacobs Choung, the Administrator of the Agricultural Research Service, and she was talking about the importance of sustainable intensification. But that's something that us is focused on. In Europe the farm to fork strategy is very much about, you know, they want to be twenty-five percent of land to be organic. By 2030 they want to cut in half fertilizer use, cut by 20% pesticides. Well, if they do that, they will produce less food.
Vonnie Estas, PMA:So they will have to import, I mean, like, how does that play out?
Jack Bobo:Right? So that they would have to import more food. And the country that sends the most food to Europe today is Brazil. In many ways, Europe has exported its environmental footprint to arguably the most bio-diverse country on the planet. You know, it takes a landmass the size of the agricultural land of Germany, to produce the soybeans for Europe. So, I mean, think about it, there's an entire Germany somewhere in the rain forest of Brazil sending soybeans back to Europe so they don't have to produce them themselves. And so it's a choice in a consequence. Europe is protecting the environment in Europe, and that's why forests are expanding in Europe. But it's also why forest are declining in Brazil.
Vonnie Estas, PMA:How do consumers deal with that dichotomy and those choices. I mean, that's too complicated when I'm standing there and deciding what product to buy in the grocery store.
Jack Bobo:Right? So it's pretty much too difficult in that moment for people to do it. So instead of trying to make the choice on a product by product basis, I think encouraging companies to have sustainability goals, see, it's hard to know what sustainable is, but it's easy to know if I'm more sustainable tomorrow than I am today or next year. Because if I can cut my water use next year from where I am today, I've done a good job. If I can reduce my energy use. So companies can track whether they're making progress, but it's hard to compare, you know, apples and oranges, as you guys know.
Jack Bobo:What's sustainable for a farmer in the Northeastern on the Chesapeake, may not be for a farmer in New Mexico. So, you know, reducing water use doesn't matter if I'm on the Chesapeake, because it's all rain fed, but it really matters if I'm in New Mexico. Producing fertilizer doesn't really matter New Mexico because, you know, that's not the limiting factor, but sure does matter if I'm trying to avoid eutrophication of waterways in the Chesapeake. So, you know, you can't even talk about the concept of sustainability and compare those to producers because the challenges they face, what makes them a good farm or, are just not the same measures at all.
Vonnie Estas, PMA:Yeah. Very true. Well, I'm going to try to get some free advice from you now. So at the produce marketing association, you know, we really want to have fruits and vegetables be a bigger part of the plate, and we really want to be the real plant-based diet with whole foods. What kinds of things can, you know, maybe not our association, but any association, like what can be done to kind of move this conversation forward around sustainability and healthier diets?
Jack Bobo:Yeah. So I think that the produce association and its members, and the products they produce are very well positioned, you know, going forward, that while 2019 in some ways was the year of the plant-based burger, you know, because the IPO from beyond. The biggest diet trend was whole foods. And so again, consumers are inconsistent on one hand, ultra processed food is one of the two biggest trends, and whole foods is the other biggest trend. But I think that if you look at dietary guidelines around the world, they are all calling for less ultra processed foods and more whole foods. So I think that you've got that opportunity. When you think about consumers, you know, most consumers know they should be eating four or five servings of fruits and vegetables a day. 90% are not doing that. There's an opportunity there when most people know they're not doing something and they kind of want to do it.
Jack Bobo:That's where, you know, the point of my book is how do we reshape our food environment to allow people to do the things they really actually want to do? It's not about convincing people to do something that they don't want, and it's not about forcing, you know, through taxes and policy interventions and other things. But, you know, just one example would be with, you may be familiar with the double bucks program that the snap has, this supplemental nutrition assistance program, where you can go to a farmer's market, you get twice the money for your food. So if you spend $10 in snap cons, you could buy $20 of produce at the farmer's market. And that seems like a great way of encouraging people to eat fresh foods. The problem is it also cost twice as much to buy food at the farmer's market. So the consumers actually getting the same volume of food they would have at the grocery store.
Jack Bobo:But the snap program is actually spending twice as much to get half as much food. But what they could be doing instead is just offering double box when consumers buy fruits and vegetables.
Vonnie Estas, PMA:Anywhere.
Jack Bobo:So yeah. Because why shouldn't I be rewarded as a consumer if I buy frozen and buy twice as much, you know, for that same money, instead of going to the farmer's market and buying half as much. Now I'm fine if they want to go to the farmer's market, people should be flexible in what they do. And so there's a lot that one could do based on dietary needs that we have, consumer actual desires, convenience. How do we make all of those things interesting to consumers so that they're not sort of looking to avoid them? How do we convey that information in a way that reaches the right people at the right time with the right message?
Vonnie Estas, PMA:So it sounds like it's a mix of policy, and psychology, and availability, and products, and all these complicated things. But do you think we're headed in a better direction in some of the things that you've seen over writing a book and some of the, you know, companies like Google and the different companies that of your clients that are really thinking about this, are you optimistic?
Jack Bobo:So I am optimistic that more and more behavioral approaches are going to be applied. I'm convinced that that's going to be the case. We've got to figure out ways of scaling these interventions. We need to find ways of making it easier for communities to get the information they need in order to help consumers make the choices they want. But in terms of innovation, you know, I'm very optimistic. I have no doubt that science and technology can help us solve the problems that we have. The question is, will we be allowed to use those tools, you know, in sort of a regulatory pessimist and a science optimist.
Jack Bobo:And, you know, we need to be able to communicate it in a way that consumers get onboard with it because the science tells us what we can do, but it's the consumer who tells us what we should do. And if the consumer doesn't understand that one choice is not going to get them where they need to be, then maybe they can begin to think a little bit more deeply. It's like, because they're choosing local sustainability because they want to help the planet. And if they can appreciate that nuance a little more, and if they trusted the company were trying to be better, than they might give them the flexibility to achieve that sustainability goal in the way they think is best.

Vonnie Estes, PMA:Welcome to PMA Takes on Tech. The podcast that explores the problems, solutions, people, and ideas that are shaping the future of the produce industry. I'm your host, Vonnie Estes, vice president of technology for the Produce Marketing Association and I've spent years in the ag tech sector. So I can attest, it's hard to navigate this ever-changing world in developing and adopting new solutions to industry problems. Thanks for joining us and for allowing us to serve as your guide to the new world of produce and technology. My goal of the podcast is to outline a problem in the produce industry and then discuss several possible solutions that can be deployed today.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:This episode of PMA Takes on Tech is sponsored by CropTrak. CropTrak helps food and beverage companies digitize their unique supply chains to easily manage data, to improve their processes today and into the future. To learn how your entire supply chain operations can work more transparently, go to croptrak.com/pma.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:Today we are having a conversation with Bolthouse Farms about innovation. The company has such an interesting history. It was founded in 1915 in Grant, Michigan. It is now a vertically integrated farm company specializing in food and beverages. It is located in the San Joaquin Valley of California with numerous regional farms. The private equity firm, Madison Dearborn Partners owned Bolthouse from 2005 to 2012. In 2012, it was bought by the Campbell Soup Company for 1.55 billion. Campbell's sold the company in 2019. From a business perspective, this journey is a fascinating story. Modern Acre podcast did a great interview with Jeff Dunn, the CEO about the various business transitions that is worth listening to. In this episode, we speak to two leaders in the company, Zak Karlen, General Manager of Farms, and Mike Rosenthal, Chief Innovation Officer and CFO. I love how innovation is woven through everything they do and think about and what having two different business models, a consumer packaged goods business, and an ag business allows you to do. Let's jump into the episode where Mike is talking about his role and how he brought Silicon Valley thinking to the company.
Michael Rosenthal, Bolthouse Farms:In that time period, I was doing technology and innovation across a broad range of companies in a wide range of areas, software, data, services, hardware, you name it, and I really got to understand quite a bit about how Silicon Valley approaches innovation and from my perspective, and you live there so you know, Silicon Valley has a unique approach in the world doing innovation and technology. What I learned there, I realized it is not just for Silicon Valley and it is not just about the application of technology, but it's actually, maybe even more so, about the application of innovation process. The innovations I've lived through, some material changes in innovation process and Silicon Valley, and I realized those things could be applied to food and ag. And so I'm here at Bolthouse Farms to do a lot of things, but one of those things is to help blend together the best of what food and ag has and the best of what Silicon Valley does from an innovation process and technology standpoint, to create the food company of the future and we're doing it.
Michael Rosenthal, Bolthouse Farms:So it's pretty exciting
Zak Karlen, Bolthouse Farms:As a CFO and CIO, he also never cuts his own budget. It's awesome.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:I bet.
Zak Karlen, Bolthouse Farms:Which is strange how it always lands in my lap.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:It uses two different sides of your brain. That really is interesting. You know, how can we be way out there and do wonderful things and then how do we control? That's a great balance for you. Zak, let's move to you and looking at your background, you've been kind of in and out of both farms, you've been in and off of farms and in food produce, tell us about your journey and what you do at Bolthouse Farms.
Zak Karlen, Bolthouse Farms:Good question. So I started at Bolthouse Farms in 1997. I was 17 years old. You can do the math. Fresh out of high school, working in maintenance, pulling pumps and motors. Did that for the summer and then went to college in Bakersfield, at Cal State Bakersfield, CSUB Roadrunners. And I went to Grimmway Farms. I worked in Grimmway Farms or aggravate farms in their field program, doing data and analytics and understanding seed. I did that for four years and then ultimately graduated with a degree in economics and went and worked for Kern Ridge Growers, which is the third largest carrot company, it's also in Bakersfield. Really, really good experience, six and a half years there working as an Operations Manager, understanding how a family run business works and pinching pennies and competing against Grimmway and Bolthouse. I got a phone call in 2007 to come back to Bolthouse Farms and start it back from the operations.
Zak Karlen, Bolthouse Farms:They were going through a transition because they were just acquired by Madison Dearborn. A private equity firm out of Chicago. Had been a family owned company from 1915 to 2005. I came over and started gobbling up part of the operations, worked from 2007 to 2017 as part of the management team that transitioned Bolthouse from Madison Dearborn to Campbell Soup. Worked for Campbell Soup for five years, got an opportunity to work in private equity. So I spent two years in the private equity world for a startup Arable Capital Partners. Then ultimately in 2019 around, Mike, it was March, April in 2019-ish. Jeff Dunn, our CEO, who was my boss in 2016, he called me and said, congratulations, you're quitting your job and you're coming home and you're going to come work for me as the GM of Farms again. And so that's what we did. We acquired the company June 17th of 2019. And we've been turning and burning it ever since.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:Yeah, it's such a great story just to... I've heard Jeff tell the story several times and just about how the different transitions in and out of Campbells and what have been always very positive about Campbell and how that opportunity was, but the pros and cons of getting the band back together and pulling Bolthouse Farms back together again, and really as one of the most innovative companies, I think, in the produce industry. You all have really done some amazing things. So what we wanted to do in this episode is to get a future view from the C-suite. So clearly, as we've talked about, Bolthouse Farms has experienced a lot of change and transformation in the past five to 10 years. Tell us about what you've learned that has helped the company maintain its leadership position in fresh food.
Michael Rosenthal, Bolthouse Farms:One of the biggest lessons in Silicon Valley, and many of the listeners may not know this story, but software development 20 years ago is very different than it is now. And the thing that transformed the software development was something called Agile software development. And what Agile software development did, was it said rather than spending a long time building a big thing, and then finding out whether it's going to work, take it in little chunks, move faster, move quickly, spend less money and in the end you will have a much more effective, less expensive, faster results. And that then got translated into business models by book that I recommend everyone read called The Lean Startup written by Eric Ries and he's showed how that process and software development can apply to business. And the very first thing I did when I got the Bolthouse Farms was started talking about lean startup.
Michael Rosenthal, Bolthouse Farms:In other words, we can do things much faster, much less expensively by just trying them, using something a lot of people call them MVP, and end up with a much better result much more quickly. And so Zak and I spent a lot of time talking through this, I do it on my teams, Zak does it on his teams, and what it does, ultimately, is allow us realize that future of food by applying a process that helps us move faster and more effectively. And we can give you a number of examples of that. Robotics and other things that we can sort of talk through in the future, but I'll turn this over to Zak to chat for a bit and then we can sort of talk through some of these specifics.
Zak Karlen, Bolthouse Farms:So when we talk about lean startup on the farm side or on the operation side, we use it in a lot of different ways, but one of the things that we're really focused in on is failure is okay, and that's a mentality that Silicon Valley has. There's like a badge of honor. If you have something that fails, you reiterate and fails, fails, and ultimately you get to this incredible solution. And so we've really taken that mentality, that Silicon Valley mentality, and inserted it into our operation. And so Wunderoots is a great example of that. It was almost a year ago today. I asked Bill Levisay, who is our head of sales, I said hey, can I have an innovation person, somebody that works in R and D because I think, the last advent in carrots was the baby carrot at 1988. What else can we do?
Vonnie Estes, PMA:Was it that long ago?
Zak Karlen, Bolthouse Farms:It was 1988. Literally I go, Bill, what else could we do? And he kind of looked at me as like, no, I don't think so. I promise, just give me somebody. So I got Kourtney Kobdish, senior scientist, and R and D. And within a week we had carrot bacon, carrot rice, carrot fettuccine, carrot hotdogs. They were taking the tops from the carrots and making pesto out of them. And we were blown away and PMA happened to be, well, I want to say 45 days later, we display these products at PMA, right? And we had no idea what we were doing. We just knew we had a really good product in Wunderoots, and that we were going to try to make it successful. How we were going to do it, no clue. To me, that's that lean startup MVP mentality that Mike's talking about, that we took that and put it to work on the farm side and Wunderoots is an incredible platform that we're just super bullish and excited about.
Michael Rosenthal, Bolthouse Farms:Yeah. A hundred percent. It was, frankly, it was incredible to watch Zak do that because you can see the results in the marketplace. And if you haven't had a carrot hotdog yet, you should.
Zak Karlen, Bolthouse Farms:It's crazy. It's crazy how good it is.
Michael Rosenthal, Bolthouse Farms:But I'll add a little bit on this as well, which is Bolthouse is a unique company in many ways. And you referenced some of our commitment to innovation from the top down, which is wholeheartedly being baked into our ethos. But one of the ways that we're relatively unique in the world is that we have a big CPG company and we have a big ag company in the same place and they're intertwined together. And what that allows us to do is look at the produce and ag equation differently than most ag companies look at it. But you know, many ag companies, I would say look at it, input costs and yields per acre and all the sort of metrics that quality that you have to. But there's another layer that we look at it with respect to particularly innovation.
Michael Rosenthal, Bolthouse Farms:And what Zak talked about from a Wunderoots standpoint is exactly right and it's incredible what he did there. We get to put a CPG lens on it. We get to say forget about the... yes, we have a bunch of projects, technology, and otherwise. Zak does an incredible job with this to take 5% of our costs out of our bag for a program, just like everyone has to, but we get to do something else, which is so important in how we think about the world and what the future of fresh is. We get to say, well, what does the consumer want? And we know that one of the things that consumer wants is a connection back to the earth. They want to understand their food and where it comes from and what it is. And they don't want to see an ingredient list of 25,000 things you can't pronounce.
Michael Rosenthal, Bolthouse Farms:But we have a whole bunch of tools that a consumer packaged goods company has to assess those consumer needs and then think about that and bring that back to the farm. So what Zak did on Wunderoots is exactly that. Hey, the consumer is moving away from meat products, hotdogs, say what you will about them. They taste...
Zak Karlen, Bolthouse Farms:Awful.
Michael Rosenthal, Bolthouse Farms:They're pretty awful. What can we do, right? The R and D team working with Zak came up with some pretty cool stuff and then we got to launch it like a consumer packaged goods companies. So we grow the carrots for it, you put it through our plans, and then we launched it, and now the consumer has a healthier choice that tastes incredible, that is a carrot, not 35,000 ingredients. So I give Zak kudos, and the rest of the team kudos for doing that, but it is something pretty unique that we have here that will impact the future of produce and food that I'm very proud of.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:Yeah, I think if you would've tried to go somewhere and sell that carrot hot dog, they wouldn't have done it. They wouldn't have taken it and so that you could take that to market yourself and kind of test some of those ideas out and also that you can be really innovative. I think it's hard for somebody to come up with something that's really unique if they're not an innovative company and take it all the way through the market. So that is really exciting and interesting that you have those two different pieces and you can get feedback loops really quickly instead of having to go try to sell it to someone that doesn't get it.
Michael Rosenthal, Bolthouse Farms:Part of the reason we're able to do that innovation in the marketplace is brand awareness, right? Bolthouse Farms is known as an innovative company, and we have a lot of chips in the poker game relative to our CPG business. With all the innovation we've done over there. Yes, they're not the same buyers, but they know Bolthouse Farms is innovative and so when we went out to customers and did market research on Wunderoots, back when we used to allow people in our facility and do a taste testing, people were like, wow, this is incredible. Like, give me carrot bacon now. Let me figure out how to make it first. But yes, as soon as I do, I'll give it to you.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:That's great. So thinking about technology again and all the innovation. So as you think about the pressures on the fresh part of the industry, how has technology and specifically data science and other technologies helping Bolthouse manage an efficient and resilient supply chain?
Michael Rosenthal, Bolthouse Farms:Yeah. I'm going to make a statement that I make a lot and I'm going to turn it over to Zak to chat a little bit, but there's something I say that I want the world to really get. From my perspective, when you think about ag technology, robotics and data science and the connection of those two things and data sciences isn't just the science, but it's the capture of the data, the organization of data and what you do with it. Are the chemicals of the future.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:Oh, I love that. That's great.
Michael Rosenthal, Bolthouse Farms:We as a world and certainly in the United States, went through a revolution in agriculture when we figured out how to use chemicals, improve yields, and other things like that. There was another revolution in genetics, GMOs, that also helped. There's obviously a great debate about whether that's good or bad. There's a bit of a debate about chemicals, good or bad, but forget about looking at the past. The future is powered by data and robotics is one of the ways of capturing it. And they are the new chemicals. That is what's going to drive the next evolution in agricultural efficiency and lots of other things and so we take that very seriously, but anyways, Zak, I know you have a lot to say about this.
Zak Karlen, Bolthouse Farms:Excuse me, it's interesting to me, for the first third or half of my career, I always thought about technology as automation, right? So how do I find a machine to replace a human inside the facility to keep that five to 10% cost reduction every year? So optics order, robotic pick and place, things of that nature. And we have a long ways to go to continue down that path, but in the last 24 months, Mike and I have really started thinking about technology and from the soil to the plant, right? And so, as he said, we've got a hundred plus years of agricultural information and knowledge, data that's kind of floating around and Excel and in some papers and in some people's heads, and we're working with CropTrak to get all of that information into a single source so that we can utilize that data to be good stewards of the land.
Zak Karlen, Bolthouse Farms:And that's really important to us at Bolthouse Farms. I think the statistic is the population is going to be 10 billion over the next decade. Well, one of the things that keeps me up at night is how the hell are we going to feed all these people, right? How are we going to feed an extra three or two and a half billion people with the same amount of land and keep everybody healthy and nutritious conscious. And one of the ways is to be really good stewards of the land and really to start transforming our thought process from the traditional cost per acre, yield per acre, input per acre, and start to think about it from a nutrition per acre standpoint, right? So how do I get the most nutrition out of that acre of ground? And I've been reminding people a lot through COVID of, we are an agricultural company first that happens to grow carrots second. And so we have to rethink how we do farming and start to think about that nutrition per acre angle and going more towards a regenerative ag process and less towards the chemical process.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:So can you give some examples of how you're doing that and what technologies you're using and how technologies are playing with each other?
Zak Karlen, Bolthouse Farms:I'll start and then Mike can take over. We have started a process in Cuyama, which is a valley, probably 60 to 70 miles west of here, a regenerative ag program. And so we took 160 acres of organic and 160 acres of conventional and have literally told our farming organization, if you had this land for the next 10, 15 years, what would you do with it? What would you do with it as a true farmer? And the outcome of that has been fascinating, in terms of cover crops, in terms of rotational crops. And if it's done correctly, if you do all of that correctly, and you're good stewards of the land, and you keep soil health in mind at all times, your input costs actually go down. You're weeding costs go down. Your quality goes up, your yields go up, right?
Vonnie Estes, PMA:How long does that take? Is that one season? Or two seasons?
Zak Karlen, Bolthouse Farms:Oh no. It could take a decade, right? I'd say it's a decade long commitment. Now you will see results and soil health within six to eight to nine months. But in terms of once you get proper rotations and once you get everything down, it could be a decade before you get to bright, right? So this is a long commitment. And then bring in Mike and the technology side with robotics and everything that they're doing. It's a fascinating program.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:Are you running that yourselves or you have other contract growers that are running that or how's that?
Zak Karlen, Bolthouse Farms:One of the beauties of working at Bolthouse Farms is we tend to do everything ourselves. Whether that's good or bad, it's chuckling because sometimes we should outsource, but that program, there's probably a core 10 of us, Mike, myself, and some other key members are running it ourselves.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:Yeah. That's great. Mike, what were you going to add on that?
Michael Rosenthal, Bolthouse Farms:No, I'll never forget when Zak came back from a trip to London or he went to a conference and said to me, Mike, it's no longer yield per acre. And I was like, what are you talking about, Zak? I have my CFO hat on.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:That yield better not go down.
Zak Karlen, Bolthouse Farms:I'm not cutting LTI budget.
Michael Rosenthal, Bolthouse Farms:And then he laid the nutrition per acre concept on me and my head exploded because I was like it's so right. So right. It's an exciting thing to think about and build into how we think about the world, but on the technology side, back to your question, there's a lot of technologies we use and I'll probably split this up a little bit, but obviously, as Zak said, the amount of data that is available from the start of the ag process, prepping the land, all the way through growing, harvesting, tracking into the plant, going through the different flows of where it might end up in the plant, into a package, onto a truck, into a warehouse, over to that grocery store, into a consumer's mouth.
Michael Rosenthal, Bolthouse Farms:I come from Silicon Valley, so what I see, like the matrix, is just a giant streams and streams and streams of data, potential and capability. A tiny, tiny sliver of which we are capturing now, but that tiny sliver is a lot bigger than it was two years ago and it's growing exponentially with a lot of great work that Zak and his team is doing. So there's one piece of this, which is how you capture and organize the data. And then there's another piece of it, which is how do you analyze the data? So I'm going to have Zak chat a little bit about capturing it and organizing it. Cause he's been doing some great things with a great partner there. This is a place where we do some outsourcing. That's good. And then maybe come back to me and I'll talk about some of the analytics around it and some of the things that I think about when we think about the future of that.
Zak Karlen, Bolthouse Farms:And we talked a little bit about the hundred plus years of farming data. We're collecting it every day, all day, from all different sources and some of it is very cumbersome. Some of it is literally individuals counting rows on how many rows of carrots we harvested and that attribute equates to, we did 10.7 acres of this field, it's difficult, right? And not only do we have a small sliver of data that we need to drive the business, that small sliver is in 15, 17 different places and it's inputted by human beings at times and it's very, very difficult to get accurate data in a very timely manner, because one of the things that I think was lost on prior ownership is carrots are living, breathing organism. They don't take Saturdays and Sundays off, they don't get Memorial day off, right?
Zak Karlen, Bolthouse Farms:And so we plant, grow, and harvest carrots 365 days a year. It's what we do. We do it every single day. And so for us to have accurate data, timely data, so that we can make very, very good decisions based on that data is really important, right? Because if you don't pay attention to the carrot crop every single day, it's the most expensive thing we have as a company, hands down, more expensive than labor, water, land, utilities, combined. Carrots are the most expensive thing we have in a company. If you don't treat that with the respect that it deserves and you don't have the right data, you can make a really poor decision and you may not feel the ramifications of said decision that moment, because it's 150, 160 day crop, but at 150 or 60 days later, you may have planted the wrong seed based on the wrong soil type, because you had poor data and now what, right? Now you've got 150 days of input costs with potentially a very poor crop. That's not going to work.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:And you need to be able to implement those decisions right away. I think a lot of times in the past we would collect all this data and then it would end up on a USB or someplace, and then someone would evaluate it and then they'd send it back and then the season's gone by and you're looking in the rear view mirror and you can't do anything with it. And so I think with these new programs where you can really get the data, have the data, make an instant decision, that's going to affect your season makes a big difference.
Zak Karlen, Bolthouse Farms:It's one of the things that I love the most about Mike is he's so analytical. Because to your point, we have all of this out there, but sometimes we don't do anything with it, right? And so with the programs that he's working on, right? It's like, okay, these are the facts, right? And you can't deny the math on this, this, and this. Let's make the best decision based on that.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:Yeah. So outside of the data management piece, what other technologies are you working on? And Mike you'd mentioned robotics. What are you guys looking at on that? And what do you think the future of robotics is going to be? It's an exciting area that we've been waiting. We've thought that's been a year away for 10 years.
Michael Rosenthal, Bolthouse Farms:I love that.
Zak Karlen, Bolthouse Farms:We're going to steal that line from us. You can steal some of ours.
Michael Rosenthal, Bolthouse Farms:I can tell you with great certainty that robotics is less than a year away. So look, robotics is not a new thing in the world. If you study the Toyota and the Toyota production system and other manufacturing areas and other places, robotics are not only a primary way that the manufacturing happens, but it's been going on for a long time. Robotics in the field, and in agriculture, is a different set of problems. Hasn't had the same kind of attention and focus and partnership that manufacturing, as an example, has had. And so it is land. It also hasn't necessarily had the willingness to invest, the capital to invest a clear way to drive a trade off and the rest of that, which I think is a little bit true.
Michael Rosenthal, Bolthouse Farms:And a lot maybe the way the ag industry and the world has, I don't think has been thinking about it well. And so robotics is the thing that we started looking at as soon as we came back in here. First of all, I've hired a number of folks from Silicon Valley, they've moved Bakersfield, California to join the innovation team because we need that thing that I talked about before, which is the blend of both of them. Neither side knows more than the other. They both have, the ag side is incredible and knows an incredible amount of them. And so does the Silicon Valley side and together is where the magic happens in collaboration. And so we pulled our network together across Silicon Valley, and I knew that the payback on robotics in agriculture would be clear.
Michael Rosenthal, Bolthouse Farms:And we went out and we looked at all the different robotic companies and ended up finding a partner that we thought we could work with and that had the kind of technology and partnership that could really help us. So we have been working on this project for, Zak, probably a year and a half, something like that. And they had actually already been working on robotic technology, just in a different industry and so me and a couple of folks flew to Silicon Valley and sat down with them and explained why carrots are actually something they should really be focusing on and convince them. And their technology, and their approach, and their team is right. And we, our attitude, our perspective, our knowledge of the ground and of the crop and of the things that we need to bring to the table and that partnership to make sure that we ended up with a robotic strategy that works is right.
Michael Rosenthal, Bolthouse Farms:And it's working. I'm not going to quote any numbers that I have, but I can tell you that we are, it is not a year away. With my CFO hat on, it's a really good cost opportunity. With our ESG oriented, good stewards of the land data and robotics are the chemicals of the future perspective and Zak's nutrition breakers perspective, and all incredible things he's doing on soil health. It is all about that because not only are we saving money at the same time, we are doing things much more effectively, efficiently, with less inputs that can take care of the land better. And so it's happening and it isn't going to stop. And we are well into that technology. Zak, I don't know if you want to add anything to that.
Zak Karlen, Bolthouse Farms:Yeah. One of the things, one of the many things, that has come out of COVID for us is the acceleration of this technology of robotics. We had to completely revamp our business in March of 2020 when this thing kind of started to happen. And we broke our employee base down into groups of 10 to keep them safe, to keep the businesses going, but simultaneously behind the scenes, Mike and I were thinking, holy crap, we got to start replacing humans with machines because there's a lot of variability in there. And in a weird way, it actually is going to create more jobs, not less jobs, right? It's going to create more technology jobs, better paying jobs, et cetera. Cause we're going to have less input costs, ergo we can invest more into employees and more into technology, but what Mike's talking about is revolutionary for us, right? For us at Bolthouse farms, in terms of being able to collect all that data, do it seamlessly, implement it, and have all the robotics. It's really, really exciting right now.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:Yeah. I think it's a really exciting time and just see. I think a lot of people will, just from my vision, I know it's been around for a long time, but it seemed like there was all these gigantic harvesters in corn and soy. And so people start thinking, well, we need gigantic harvesters. Like let's start there. And now I'm seeing different types of things, harvest aids, small like borough, small carts going up and helping with harvesting and people like robotics that are having a different approach to how do we thin and weed. And so it really is exciting. And all of that, like you said, it's all... You have to have the data to make the decisions. It's all tied in together.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:And if you don't have the data to know where to squirt that weed or how things are growing and what they need to look like, then, you can't use the robotics so that makes a ton of sense. So as you peek around the corner, a decade from now, what trends do you see converging that the fresh industry needs to be building towards now? Like new innovations or adoption or application of existing technologies?
Zak Karlen, Bolthouse Farms:Yeah. I think Wunderoots is one of them for us, right? Right now we're living in it. It is a product that is potentially going to replace hotdogs, at least a portion of hotdogs. And one of the things that Mike has taught me over the last year is one of the reasons that Oatly is so successful is it's going after milk, right? One of the reasons that Impossible or Beyond are so successful is they're going after beef, which is a multi-trillion dollar industry. If you think about it, I think the numbers close, like there are 20 billion hotdogs consumed annually in America.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:Oh my gosh.
Zak Karlen, Bolthouse Farms:Yeah. [crosstalk 00:33:12] You know, I'm going to quote Jeff Dunn, according to Jeff Dunn, our CEO or 20, I mean, that's a lot, right? You get 1% of that. You know, we have a really, really good product that could potentially take a half percent, 1%. And for us it's like, okay, what else can you do with carrots? Or with vegetables? What else is out there that we're looking at it as part of this regenerative ag. Okay, we're going to create 10 or 15 other vegetables that we're going to be growing, cover crops, soy, et cetera, what else can we do, so that we're equal good stewards of the land, but also continuing to be an innovative company? And that's where Mike really steps in with his Silicon Valley experience and his vision around technology and stuff.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:I think we, at PMA, we talk about... we really are, and produce really is the plant-based diet. We really should be taking on more of the plate and we are the plant-based diet. And so I love that you guys are looking at that and there's lots of room for all the other companies that you mentioned, but I think really going back and looking at let's really get people nutrition, not just pretending that it's meat, but let's get people having high, nutritious food that they want to eat.
Michael Rosenthal, Bolthouse Farms:The produce industry needs to evolve towards nutrition. And what I mean by that is, and I'm not going to talk about carrots for a second. Take an apple or a head of lettuce or whatever else it is. The focus for a very long time has been, how do I get more apples? How do I get bigger heads of lettuce? How do I create as much of a just in time situation as you can, but also since there's seasonality and issues and droughts and whatever else happens, how do I extend the shelf life of my apple or whatever else it is so that the economics of that equation work, and I can still deliver an apple to a consumer in May, et cetera. Whether that apple tastes great, whether that apple's nutritional content in terms of antioxidants and other things, and I'm not going after the apple industry, I'm just using apples, I'm just saying as an example, it could be insert carrots or anything else.
Michael Rosenthal, Bolthouse Farms:Yes. You might be delivering ahead of lettuce to consumer or an apple or a carrot or whatever, but what is that? Food is nutrition for our bodies so we can stay healthy. And it may look like an apple, it may look like a head of lettuce, smell like one, be bigger than it was last year, et cetera. The real question that this industry needs to ask itself, if it wants to do great things for the world 10 years from now like you just described, is how do I make sure that what gets in the consumer's hands and into their mouth is more nutritionally dense than it was last year or five years ago and 10 years ago. And the consumer... And if they're not thinking about that now, they're making a big mistake because I can tell you based from the consumer side of our business, the consumer sure is thinking about it.
Michael Rosenthal, Bolthouse Farms:And the next generation of consumers that is graduating from college and demanding all kinds of things that we read about in the news. It is demanding that for themselves and their kids are going to demand it for themselves. I promise you, and I'm not going to go into all the details, cause there is some secret sauce at Bolthouse Farms, but I promise you that we are thinking about that right now. So that five years from now, and 10 years from now, we are delivering more nutrition in the form of a carrot or anything else then we are doing now because in the end, that's going to win in the marketplace.
Michael Rosenthal, Bolthouse Farms:That's what the consumer is really going to want. I promise, you'll see this in the data shifting in the next 10 years. And so the whole industry needs to understand that a focus on that using technology innovation and soil health, and a lot of other things that you can do right now will actually grow their business 10 years from now because they'll be delivering, they'll be matching what the consumer wants, not just what is optimizing the supply chain for 10 years from now.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:I know many of my listeners work for startups and companies with new innovations who might be interested in engaging with Bolthouse Farms. You can send an email to innovation@bolthouse.com to get the conversation going with them. Hear Mike and Zak talk about the importance of collaboration and working with outside innovative companies.
Michael Rosenthal, Bolthouse Farms:Innovation is in our ethos. And we want to hear from startups who have great solutions. And even if we can't take advantage of it ourselves, we want to help them, because it's good for the world. If you want to come work at Bolthouse Farms and you're innovative, please come work with us. If you want a startup and you've got a cool technology, we'd probably want to try it. And if we don't want to try and we probably want to help you anyway. So, yeah.
Zak Karlen, Bolthouse Farms:Yeah, one of the beauties of being at Bolthouse Farms is we're so big and have so many connections that some of these startups, their application may not be applicable to what we do, but we can definitely get you to the right person to help you be successful.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:Well, there you have it, an open invitation. Hope you enjoyed the episode and see you next week.

Vonnie Estes, PMA:Welcome to PMA Takes on Tech, the podcast that explores the problems, solutions, people and ideas that are shaping the future of the produce industry. I'm your host Vonnie Estes, Vice President of technology for the Produce Marketing Association. And I've spent years in the ag tech sector, so I can attest, it's hard to navigate this ever changing world and developing and adopting new solutions to industry problems. Thanks for joining us and for allowing us to serve as your guide to the new world of produce and technology. My goal of the podcast is to outline a problem in the produce industry and then discuss several possible solutions that can be deployed today.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:Today we hear a rebroadcast of a PMA Virtual Town Hall on the carbon economy. Where is the money for the producers? My guests are Martin Lowenfish, the branch chief of area wide planning at the Natural Resources Conservation Service. In case you don't know, NRCS, formerly known as the Soil Conservation Service, is an agency of the USDA that provides technical assistance to farmers and other private landowners and managers. Martin will give us his view on climate smart agriculture and forestry and the programs he's working on.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:Next we hear from two companies who are very active in this space. We have Radhika Moolgavkar from Nori. Nori's goal is to create a platform for anyone to buy carbon credits. Radhika leads the supply and methodology group and is responsible for operationalizing supply into the Nori marketplace and developing new methodologies. And Ben Carson from Granular Corteva, who is a leader of carbon credits, ecosystem services. Corteva, is developing a number of partnerships and working with farmers to get carbon payment from their soil health practices.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:And we hear from Paul Lightfoot, Paul has been deeply involved in food and ag for 20 years, he is using his influence and platform to talk about negative foods. We will hear what he has seen in the system and what consumers think. After the town hall aired, I had a listener that wanted to dig deeper into the question of what is in it for producers. Listen at the end of the podcast to hear where that conversation netted out. I will drop you into the conversation as we jump into these carbon topics.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:Good morning, and good afternoon to everyone. Thank you for being part of this call. Like all of you, I'm interested in where we are now with the carbon economy and where this is all headed. From introducing practices to sequester carbon and reduce greenhouse gases on farm, to taking a valid soil sample, to analyzing that sample, to monetizing all of this to the farmer. There's a great deal of complexity and unknowns. How is data collected? What is valid data? Who gets to say what valid data is? How does a producer get credit? What part does the government play and what do consumers think? We will try to unpack some of these questions and more today, with my guests. We have a great group of people that really span this whole part of the system of the carbon economy. So let's start with Martin and find out about what's going on with USDA and the government and what you're thinking about. So can you tell us, Martin, what you do and what's going on at the agency?
Martin Lowenfish, NRCS:Well, thank you, Bonnie, and great to be talking with everyone today. As Paul was just saying I'm the branch chief for area wide planning at NRCS. And so I'll use that term NRCS just to get the acronyms out of the way. Hopefully you're all familiar with that. But for nearly 100 years since the dust bowl NRCS is providing farmers, ranchers and forest landowners with assistance to conserve their agricultural resources. And by extension, the natural resources of the nation. And now we know very much that carbon is part of that equation. And at the highest level NRCS provides farmers, ranchers and forest owners and I'm going to say just farmers for simplicity here, with financial and technical assistance to address the conservation needs on their operations. So that is key for us in that NRCS works with producers on a voluntary basis. So we can provide assistance to farmers who asked us for the help.
Martin Lowenfish, NRCS:The biggest source of funding we have to meet those needs is the farm bill, which provides about $4 billion annually, mostly to plan and cost share, though it's not technically called cost share anymore. Certain legal niceties, but to provide that financial assistance or cost share for conservation improvements on farmers lands. Significant funding also goes to easement programs.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:So around carbon sequestration and the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, what are the programs that NRCS is getting involved with? And what are the programs in those areas that are available?
Martin Lowenfish, NRCS:Well before I do any sort of deep dive onto the NRCS part, I want to highlight some of the Secretary's agenda here. And the first thing is back in May, the department published the 90 day plan that really highlighted some central principles. And that central to USDA's approach is the concept that to be effective, whatever we do must work for farmers, ranchers, and landowners, and that we must pursue strategies that create new markets, that talks to the purpose of this webinar today, new markets for rural America is to build wealth that stays in rural communities. That's available on the web, easy to find, and I'm sure we can provide some links to this distribution if we want to. I'm not going to read that report to you. It's been read into the record, it's available too you.
Martin Lowenfish, NRCS:But some of the highlights there that the Secretary has positioned us to prepare USDA to quantify, track and report the benefits of what our buzzword here is climate smart agriculture and forestry practices. So that quantification piece is key to the approach, that we want to leverage existing programs. And also support new and better markets for agriculture and forestry products generated through these climate smart agriculture and forestry practices. Also note that the Secretary Vilsack spoke last week, had a big climate announcement.
Martin Lowenfish, NRCS:That is available on YouTube, and we can share some links. Key to that and to this group, is that we have a big request for information that's out on the Federal Register right now. As the secretary indicated that he would have existing programs. But he also indicated that there's going to be about another $500 billion available through a new climate smart agriculture and forestry partnership program. And we're taking comments now about how to best shape that program.
Martin Lowenfish, NRCS:Otherwise that's all the future and the broad plans. But like I said, we do provide that voluntary assistance to address natural resource concerns on your operation, in plain language, that's conservation issues like soil erosion, loss of nutrients to surface or groundwater and air quality issues among many there. And often, those conservation systems that address those other needs, also result in carbon sequestration and greenhouse gas reductions. And I think that's the biggest part that we can play supporting these climate smart agriculture and forestry practices on working operations.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:Great, thanks. So the best way for people to getting engaged and see what's going on is to go to the website, and there's links there for them to get their questions answered.
Martin Lowenfish, NRCS:Yeah, well, no, absolutely. And engaging with NRCS, certainly there's the website. But one of the most valuable tools on our website is the office finder where you can get information about contacting your local office. So NRCS has nearly 3,000 offices around the country, where we have planners and program folks out there who are working with individual producers, farmers to develop solutions for their operations. So look to find your state's NRCS website, look to find your local office, look to find your state conservationist who's the lead for NRCS in each state.
Martin Lowenfish, NRCS:And we can talk about that some more, but really, we are, we are a locally led agency. And we have staff and partner staff all across the country for you to engage with.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:Great. All right, thank you. We'll circle back around and talk more about your involvement. But for right now let's move on to two of the companies who are very involved in this space and are working with producers and figuring out how to capture, model, measure and monetize. I will have you both introduce yourselves and then we will ask questions. So first Radhika please tell us about Nori and your role.
Radhika Moolgavkar, Nori:Yeah, thanks Vonnie for having me, and I'm really happy to be here. As was mentioned, my name is Radhika, I work for a company called Nori. We're based in Seattle, and we're a voluntary carbon marketplace. So some people might have heard of registries like Verra, Gold Standard. We are sort of like them in that we have developed our own methodology for creating carbon credits for US cropland producers. But we also take it one step further, in that we create the carbon credit, which is called an NRT, or a Nori Carbon Removal Tonne, we sell it, and we sell it on our marketplace. So we have both suppliers who create the credit and demand, which are the buyers who purchase our carbon credits. So that's us in a nutshell.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:All right, Ben, you work with farmers who are changing their practices and getting credits. And you started with Granular which is now Corteva. And there's some other programs that could have is working on so tell us about what you're doing and what your role is.
Ben Gordon, Corteva Agriscience:Yeah, thanks Vonnie. Corteva is one of the largest pure play agriculture companies in the United States and beyond, a large footprint in row crops and specialty. And you really think about that footprint, we really see our role in this space, as focusing on the farmer and providing access to those programs. And really focusing in on where we can play best, which is really we have significant sales and support outreach, so that we can actually help farmers with the practice change, not just a program. We have digital tools to help simplify the tracking and the quantification.
Ben Gordon, Corteva Agriscience:And then we work across multiple programs with folks like Nori, and others, Indigo and ESMC, to provide farmers access to these programs. So we don't build marketplaces, we don't do our own quantification, we really focus on a lot of that support that we can provide and simplicity and trying to drive to scale in this space. Because a lot of folks call it the Wild West, we're trying to change that from a simplicity standpoint. And not trying to do everything in the space and just really, really focus on the farm.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:So Ben the farmer is your customer, your that's who you're interacting with anyway, with all your other inputs and all the other things that Corteva does. And so what so when you go and you talk to a producer about the carbon economy and potential carbon credits, what's the conversation? Are you selling them something or like, what's the interaction there?
Ben Gordon, Corteva Agriscience:Some would say I'm a really lazy salesperson. So I'm trying to sell a check, or revenue. But before we even get to that, the first things we talk about are agronomy, agronomy, agronomy, then let's talk about carbon. Payments today don't justify a lot of these practice transitions by themselves. And so these things have to make sense holistically. And even if you look at the climate accounting, yield still matters, land use changes. And farmers are here to run a big business.
Ben Gordon, Corteva Agriscience:And so really, for us, it's how do we look at the whole system's level view, not just about our products or what we're doing? Is this the right choice for an operation? And then where can a carbon program de-risk or accelerate a practice change? Now, when you combine things with USDA programs, the NRCS has been doing this a long time. Other programs that exist I think we'll be able to expand it so more and more folks, the business case will make sense, both economically and economically. But today, it's really that focus on those that have some interest in these practices today, and then we help to kind of tip the scale on the business case, so they can move either faster, or with a little less risk.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:Great, thanks. And Radhika, from what you said, it sounds like both people are your customers. So explain kind of how your business model works and kind of what your product is and how you interact on both sides of the chain.
Radhika Moolgavkar, Nori:Yeah, so we also work directly with some farmers. Not in the same way that Ben's company does, obviously, we work with them to bring their data, which is where we work with the Cortevas of the world to bring their data into our system. We model that data through a tool called soil metrics, which then creates the incremental carbon change due to that practice change. And that is the value that we monetize or quantify, as Ben mentioned. And that's what I mentioned earlier than NRT are the Nori carbon removal tonne. That represents one tonne of carbon dioxide sequestered in the soil for 10 years.
Radhika Moolgavkar, Nori:And that is what we then sell to our buyers. One of Nori's goals is to always ensure that all levels of both farmer and buyer can participate in our marketplace, which has sometimes been a barrier in previous iterations of these registries. So our real goal is to make sure that even the smallest buyer and the smallest supplier can participate as I mentioned. And so we list them on our marketplace and we have individuals buying like one NRT or whatever they think their carbon footprint for the year might be.
Radhika Moolgavkar, Nori:All the way up to big corporations who are interested in partnering with us to purchase buyers. Our sweet spot is sort of that small and medium sized business who really is interested in their carbon footprint and how to do a better job, how to be sustainable, often working within local communities. And our product to them is easy. They understand what it is, and they don't have to do a lot of due diligence to feel like they are making an impact.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:Great. Yeah, there's so many different questions that go on with this. But one I did want to ask is I get confused and just looking at different marketplaces. So is there a set price of carbon. Where are we on pricing of carbon? And either one of you can answer that one.
Radhika Moolgavkar, Nori:I would say no, there's no set price of carbon as been I'm sure as well aware working with Indigo and ESMC. On Nori's marketplace right now we're selling for $15 and that's the set price the farmer set. So in our marketplace, a farmer determines the price they want to pay for carbon, or they want people to pay them for carbon. So it's $15 we take a transaction fee on top of that we charge the buyer so they get all of that 15. If we really want to go down the rabbit hole, but we probably don't have time we're also a cryptocurrency company. So we're launching Nori, which is a cryptocurrency token which we hope will drive true price discovery around carbon because I think we can all agree that the current pricing in the US particularly is way too low for the type of change we want to drive.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:And Ben you probably don't get that involved in the price then if you're kind of... You're working with the farmer, but then you're working through your partnership networks that are setting the price more, is that right?
Ben Gordon, Corteva Agriscience:Yeah, so we have to some extent. A farmer is not going to just sign up without understanding what their forward pricing is going to look like. So the way that we structure our contracts is we want to be on the same side of the table as the farmer. So we guarantee now and in the future and simple both English and legalese that you know 75% of the credit value is going to go to the farmer and then we have a $15 a tonne price minimum. Really that's because we see carbon credit pricing significantly increasing. You can look at the Bank of America, JP Morgan, everyone and their dog has a projection out there. And really we want to make sure that our farmers are able to capture that upside and we're not artificially locking them in, so they can hold us accountable to now have aligned incentives but to re-earn the business.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:And Radhika on the cryptocurrency, I know one of the problems around carbon credits is that they get resold or there's no way to really trace them. So is the cryptocurrency a way to... So are you setting that up so that you can kind of track them and it can't be corrupted that they can be resold the credits?
Radhika Moolgavkar, Nori:Yeah, actually, you totally hit the nail on the head Vonnie. I didn't mention it but our... We have actually two crypto assets. We have the NRT which I mentioned and the Nori token which we haven't launched. The NRT is also written to the blockchain and so when it is sold, it gets retired and can never be resold again. Then the question becomes well what's the commodity that's trading and the commodity that we want to trade eventually is the Nori. Which represents the carbon credit but every time it's used a new NRT would be retired and sold. So more carbon is constantly being drawn down but the Nori can be recycled within the economics community. So yes, that is our hope that this will be a solution to some of the carbon accounting problems out there.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:So to both of you again, what do you think is missing in the technology of sampling data analysis and reporting. There's that whole layer of how do we sample and then how do we model and how accurate are the models and how is the data analyzed and that piece to me, because I'm looking at the technology of all this, is really exciting. But where are we there? And do we have a long ways to go before we feel really confident in that and how good is good enough?
Ben Gordon, Corteva Agriscience:Yeah, I guess I would say you need to start with what the buyers need and start with the money. And really, it comes down to what type of asset are you generating. So there's obviously a Nori asset that Radhika has described, but then there are just offsets from registries or scope three emissions reductions. And all of them have different requirements. And so I think the biggest thing that's missing, at least from my seat in the house, is a little bit of standardization. There's no number two yellow carbon out there.
Ben Gordon, Corteva Agriscience:There's not the same grading you'd see. And especially if you look at a lot of the folks who are PMA members it's going to really come down to what is the claim that either a company is trying to make or they're trying to influence the consumer. Because that's going to directly dictate the measurement uncertainty that you're willing to tolerate, and which is then going to dictate what the underlying technology that we need is.
Radhika Moolgavkar, Nori:Yeah, I would agree with Ben. And I would add that I think it is very early days in soil carbon. And there's a lot of excitement which generates, I think a lot of new ideas and visions. But at the same time, it has to be tempered with the reality that even the science of soil, even if you're measuring it, there's not a... It's not clear always about the incremental carbon, the amount of carbon being stored, the long term storage.
Radhika Moolgavkar, Nori:And so I feel like we are making great progress. And all of this work actually only helps develop the models, helps develop soil sampling and testing that is both cost effective, and practical, because that's one of the things we struggle with at Nori is how do you roll out something that both a farmer can afford to do or a third party and potentially, and also doesn't disrupt the way they farm and is also academically meaningful.
Radhika Moolgavkar, Nori:That being said, all this data that we're providing to the models through our system, we think is improving the models. And it's just, with the different programs that the USDA is thinking of rolling out, you can see all sorts of opportunities to make it better and smarter and more efficient.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:Yeah, I think this is a really interesting time, early stage of any kind of business opportunity or technology. In that we could measure every tiny little micron on the soil, and we could make it really complicated and super costly and get all the information eventually. But like you said, We need something that you can roll out that is cost effective, and people can actually use. And so trying to find that sweet spot of what is really going to work to give us the information that we need and not make it so cumbersome, just because we can get the data.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:So I think it's a really interesting time to figure out that balance. So we'll come back to you guys, but I'm going to move down the supply chain and talk to Paul. And before I get started with Paul, to the audience, we are going to open it to audience questions, as Scott said in the beginning, so start thinking about your questions. And I'll be reading them as you type them in. Because we want to get everybody involved in this conversation.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:I have tons of questions. But I know other people do too, because this is such a new area. So moving to Paul. So, Paul, we've talked a number of times, and I've been really excited about your long history in Food and Ag and now you're using your insight and your voice and your platform, you have a newsletter called negative foods newsletter that discusses how a food system based on carbon negative foods can be leveraged to reverse climate change. And you've been making a lot of noise about this. And it's great to have a voice out there. So let's just jump in. And can you tell us what you mean when you say negative foods and talk a little bit about your newsletter and kind of what your orientation is right now?
Paul Lightfoot, BrightFarms:Yeah, I'd love to. Thanks for having me. And thanks for that fun question. So I think just super high level, that the food system is responsible for, let's say, a third of global greenhouse gas emissions. Some people say more, some people say less, but let's start with that. And which means it's just as important as transportation and energy and lots of other things as well.
Paul Lightfoot, BrightFarms:Food, though, is different than those other things. It's unique in a couple ways. One is that we have to eat constantly. Every person has to keep eating every day to survive. So we're making personal choices that directly impact our personal carbon footprints in a way that's a little bit different often with transportation and energy. But it's also unique in that some foods can have carbon negative footprints. And that's what I mean by negative foods. Foods with let's say neutral or negative carbon footprints.
Paul Lightfoot, BrightFarms:And what I mean by that is that some food can be produced in a way that doesn't release carbon, but draws carbon from the atmosphere. And so if we can eat food that draws down carbon on a net basis, the food system could be a lever to reverse climate change. We may get to renewable energy in the United States, like it is in a place like Iceland, let's say, and then you're getting to neutral or flat. But with food, we could imagine a future world where large parts of the food system aren't neutral or flat but are actually a lever to pull carbon from the atmosphere.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:That's great. And can you give some examples? I've seen several examples in your newsletter but just give some examples of types of foods or companies that you've seen that are going this direction?
Paul Lightfoot, BrightFarms:Yeah, I think maybe the one that's starkest and maybe most important and a little bit easiest to understand because it's been studied a lot is beef. And I'll start with that because industrial beef is probably the worst offending actor in the climate space. And I say that recognizing a lot of people might not like that. But that's the reality. If you're eating you industrial beef, you are cranking a lever that's releasing a ton of greenhouse gas emissions, both from the way that the cows are fed. They're eating grains that are produced with fertilizer that's produced with natural gas.
Paul Lightfoot, BrightFarms:They're often grown in places where deforestation released thousands of years of stored carbon. And the animals themselves are releasing a lot of methane. It's a catastrophe for greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. But if you're growing beef in what we'll call a regenerative way, and I won't go into details on that. There's lots of people more expert, including it at the NRCS, than I am on that. But if you're going to be for generatively, which takes a lot more space, which can be more expensive to do in some cases, you can actually have beef that's being produced in a way that's removing carbon from the atmosphere.
Paul Lightfoot, BrightFarms:A couple of companies recently have talked about LCAs that they've had done. One is White Oaks Pasture, and another is Bell Campo. And there's a couple other companies out there like Hickory Nut Gap that are starting to market their beef as regenerative. Meaning it's climate positive, where it's, as I say, a negative food. So that's an example where I think consumers could see themselves shifting their food choices from one of the worst actors on a climate scale to one of the best actors. And it's the easiest example I think people understand.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:Yeah, there was an article in The Economist recently about is beef, the next coal. Because it does have a huge effect. And there's ways to mitigate that. It doesn't mean that everyone has to stop eating beef. So what role... Where to consumers come in on this? And what do consumers know now? And is there going to be a poll by consumers? Is that how this whole thing is going to get funded and move forward by consumer pull? And how does that happen?
Paul Lightfoot, BrightFarms:Yeah, well, I agree with what Radhika said earlier that it's early days. And so we can pull out our crystal balls, it's very hard to see what the future is going to store. A lot of smart people don't think it will be consumers changing things. I happen to think that consumers will be a driving force. I think we're already seeing that consumers are increasingly choosing foods with improved carbon footprints. And I think next year, when you see big food companies like Unilever start voluntarily putting carbon labels on their products, I think you're going to see consumer demand favoring food and that's going to create a virtuous cycle that makes this a bit of a race to the top.
Paul Lightfoot, BrightFarms:But consumers already perceive to some degree correctly, that negative foods are better for the planet, because they reverse climate change. They're starting to see that in many cases, it's also better for their health. Generally, healthy soil will lead to more nutrition and food. So there's this beautiful correlation between food that's good for the planet, and food that's good for your human health. And consumers, in my opinion, will pay more for such foods, and will choose negative foods over other foods, meaning negative foods will increasingly capture greater market share.
Paul Lightfoot, BrightFarms:And when this happens, you're going to see market forces guiding farmers and food companies toward more practices that are regenerative and store carbon. And I'm not the guy that talks about the best practices of no till and animal integration and cover crops and things like that. I'm the one that's out there talking about how when consumers choose these sorts of food, food startups and big food companies will increasingly offer these sorts of foods. And those market forces will incentivize the farming industry to transform itself to be more regenerative.
Paul Lightfoot, BrightFarms:And I think over the next five years, you're going to see what I call a cheerful tidal wave of carbon negative foods to the market. And that rise in market share of negative foods is going to be one of the factors that draws carbon from the atmosphere, and helps us as a society, reverse climate change in the future.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:How will consumers know? What's the best way to communicate with them do you think? That they'll know... Say it's something like produce where there's not a lot of labeling? How will we communicate with consumers to let them know this is a food that is grown in a certain way?
Paul Lightfoot, BrightFarms:So you're asking the hardest question, or the part of the puzzle, that's the least solved right now. Consumers don't have good information right now. And that's, in my opinion, a catastrophe. If consumers could see clear information on the carbon footprint of their foods, I think you would see shifts happening that dramatically faster rates than we're seeing now. So I do think that carbon labeling is the super biggest, most important missing thing in the marketplace.
Paul Lightfoot, BrightFarms:I think that governments in the United States are very far from implementing any sort of standardization. I think you're actually going to see big food companies doing it first. And I mentioned example of Unilever, there's a lot of European companies that are even further along in the EU and the UK. And I think that when you do see effective carbon labeling, I mean effective meaning it gives knowledge to consumers that they can trust, and they can act on, that's when you're going to start really seeing the flywheel start to spin. But for now, by the way, it's a mess.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:So that kind of leads to a question, I want to open it back up to everybody and just ask each of you, what do you see is needed for this total system to work. And I think, by total system we're trying to mitigate climate change and reverse climate change. And then we're also trying to... There's kind of two things, we're trying to set up this carbon credit system, that gets people to start using these different kinds of systems and make healthier soil. So what do each of you think is missing from where you sit? And it sounds like Paul, let's start with you. It sounds like you think really communicating with the consumers is probably the thing that's missing. Is that would you say-
Paul Lightfoot, BrightFarms:Since already said that a lot, I'll add one more thing.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:Okay, add another one.
Paul Lightfoot, BrightFarms:There's a few things that are happening right now that are amazing and amazingly good. And one of them is that the world's biggest investors, like the LPS, and all the funds, these are the sovereign wealth funds, these are the endowments, these are the big foundations, offices. They're all putting these sort of ESG mandates on the asset managers that are putting the money into the marketplace. And a lot of these mandates are focused on reversing climate change.
Paul Lightfoot, BrightFarms:And because there aren't that many places for it to happen, there is pressure funneling toward food. One of our problems, putting aside carbon labeling, which I think is one of the biggest problems is that there's not a good definition of what regenerative is, let's say. And I think we're running the risk as a society of regenerative being green washed or being made a little bit meaningless sort of naturally as a label right now. So I think that getting to a point where regenerative is defined in a way that the world's biggest and most serious investors could believe in, I think that would end up shifting more capital towards solving these problems.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:Martin, you want to jump in on that one?
Martin Lowenfish, NRCS:Well as USDA, or at least my part of USDA, we don't have a lot to say about the consumer side, but I'd like to sort of pick up something that Ben mentioned. And that as producers adopt these new production practices, ones that can be regenerative, sequester carbon, and otherwise build soil health, there's not a small amount of risk. And even though they can recognize that for their own broadly that there's production benefits, as well as these broader goods that are being produced for them. There is an adoption curve. And that's something where NRCS can help both with the payments and the technical assistance, as well as the market. So there's a basket of tools here in producers to use as they shift their production methods. That even though they are broadly beneficial, and can be beneficial to their options, it's still a learning curve. And it's a big decision that a producer has to make each year.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:Great, thanks, Ben or Radhika any idea on what's needed for the total system to work?
Ben Gordon, Corteva Agriscience:I would just kind of lean towards that a little bit more on standardization. I think we're seeing tremendous increases in technologies to measure whether it's nitric oxide or other greenhouse gases, as well as soil carbon, often supported by the government and public private partnerships. But when we really get down to it, if we still don't have simple incentives, or simple ways to at least quantify the accuracy of how we measure. And as soon as we're able to connect the financial incentives with the scientific incentives, we're going to be able to build programs and the market itself will drive simplicity.
Ben Gordon, Corteva Agriscience:Today, there's just a little too much complexity. And there's a lot of zero sum thinking in agriculture. And so a lot of us probably just need to get over ourselves a little bit and realize we're not going to own the whole value chain. And now we need to partner with all players.
Radhika Moolgavkar, Nori:Yeah, I would say I think a lot about transparency and connections, I think that there, we really do still lack a lot of transparency, from what Paul mentioned around what consumers think they're purchasing versus what it really means. All the way up to the supply chain. We lack transparency within the accounting of these carbon credits and how you generate that. And I think as Ben was saying, that requires partnerships and connections and a role of like the government is probably standardizing things as well as the private sector in working together to figure these big picture questions out.
Radhika Moolgavkar, Nori:Because when I take a step back, as a consumer, I'm always confused. And I would like to do what's right, but I don't know what's right. And so I feel like all parts of the supply chain play a role in this and the voluntary carbon markets do as well.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:Great. I'm starting to get some questions from the audience, and please keep those coming. So I'm going to shift to some of these. So anyone can answer this. But Paul's kind of been the one that's been touching on this. Is there any evidence that consumers would be willing to pay more for carbon friendlier products?
Paul Lightfoot, BrightFarms:So I'm going to make an analogy that I think is responsive. It's debatable about whether the organic movement has fulfilled its promise. When organics became a mainstream, the hope is that it would reduce the use of pesticides in this country and sort of be better for the environment. As I think everyone on the call knows, like almost none of American farmland is organic. And the use of pesticides, and synthetic fertilizers has increased a lot in the last 20 years.
Paul Lightfoot, BrightFarms:So in some ways, organic hasn't met its promises, that might be controversial. But one thing it's shown for sure, I don't think this is debatable, is that consumers will pay more for the perceived benefits of food that's better for the environment, and better for their health. And I think that we can take to the bank. To the degree that consumers see food that's produced with better carbon footprints. Let's say that's got a regenerative supply chain, I'm absolutely certain they'll pay more for it based on what we've seen in last 20 years with organics.
Paul Lightfoot, BrightFarms:So I think the answer is a resounding yes. And right now, people don't really get this connection that I hope will become better known, which is the connection between soil health and human health. If a food is better for the climate, it's almost certainly going to be better for your nutrition as well. And I hope that the science and the standardization catches up on that as well, because that will even goose the demand for consumers to pay more, even higher.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:Great thanks, does Corteva and or Nori work internationally, especially Guatemala. We just started a carbon program, but technology and information are very hard to get or find.
Radhika Moolgavkar, Nori:We do not unfortunately, at this point. We're us croplands focused only but we're a small little startup, we're growing, we definitely want to move into Latin America. We have some partners who really want us to move into Latin America. So I do believe it'll be happening in the future. I just can't tell you when in the future.
Ben Gordon, Corteva Agriscience:Yeah, and not a small little startup. But a somewhat similar story, and probably for a lot of the similar reasons. One of the big things and I know I'm a broken record here, but how do we quantify? And do we have the data to make sure that we're actually measuring real outcomes. That's really the big barrier, whether it's new geographies, or new cropping systems, which is a big thing. I think in produce, especially when you have crops that have smaller acreage footprints, maybe not as much of research behind them, or in specific geos where it's similar, all of a sudden the uncertainties of how we measure our increase in the error bars are higher than even what the payments might be.
Ben Gordon, Corteva Agriscience:And so I think there's a scientific element of that, and then there's just a normal business element. But I think there's a lot of folks, both public and private, including us, they're working on international expansion. And expansion to new model domains like new crops.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:Here's a question I don't know that we'll have the answer to but it's interesting. At one time, food miles was presented as a reliable decision basis to benefit the environment. It was then largely discredited. What is the current thinking on food miles? Does anyone have a view on that, or how it's looked at?
Paul Lightfoot, BrightFarms:I feel like I champion to local produce company for a long time and still do. So maybe I should be on the defensive on that question. I actually, I don't think it ever was a broad brush rule. Being local was only better when it was better. So products that stored and shipped very cheaply like grains, I don't think were likely to be better for the environment when they were growing locally, if the circumstances weren't better for growing.
Paul Lightfoot, BrightFarms:I don't think that was different 20 years ago, than 10 years ago, or 10 weeks ago. At BrightFarms we thought that decentralized salads produced in the same communities was better. So I don't think anything has changed necessarily. I still think it's a matter of the actual footprint of the production methods and the way that it's shipped. And that's, by the way, something that should be able to be done somewhat mathematically.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:Is there a danger that environmental activist groups will use negative publicity such as the Dirty Dozen list to highlight ag commodities with a big carbon footprint?
Paul Lightfoot, BrightFarms:If commodities have high carbon footprints I hope they get negative publicity, bring it.
Radhika Moolgavkar, Nori:I guess all I was going to say is I think there is a real opportunity to get in front of this and to provide a better story than what could be out there. I think nobody disputes those facts is just what's your response to those facts. And I think that's where these opportunities will lie. And the better we do in being transparent, the better we will be with our story to the environmental activists and the rest.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:I think from a PMA perspective, we certainly highlight member stories and like our sustainability cases, and I think around this area, with the carbon economy, we're right now just trying to help our members understand what the opportunities are. And we will continue to highlight success stories and communicate this as we're all trying to kind of understand it.
Paul Lightfoot, BrightFarms:And Vonnie, with respect to PMA, it's probably worth remembering that whole fruits and vegetables are almost certainly on the good actor, end of the spectrum compared to most of our food system. So they're in a hell of a good starting place.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:What do you think about how reducing food loss the amount of food not sold left in the field or otherwise culled out during farm operations, would help reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Greater sell through of product grown, may increase income for farmers or gets surplus food to people in need? Is there a role for the carbon economy to stimulate these benefits?
Ben Gordon, Corteva Agriscience:I'd just say if you look at the World Resource Institute and other organizations that spent a lot of time thinking about this, it's one of the biggest levers that's identified out there. I think the big question as it relates to carbon programs is what's the right... We don't want these programs to be one size fits all, because then they get incredibly overly complex. And so it's just finding what's the right benefit from the combination of incentives and kind of environmental and economic. Usually, there's pretty significant economic incentives to do that already. And so it's where do you need the environmental incentive to maybe push things over the top?
Vonnie Estes, PMA:A product like mushrooms grows in natural composted agricultural materials, and after harvest, there is nitrogen rich compost that can be reused? Can it be considered a carbon negative food? Or would you need to evaluate many other aspects to determine?
Paul Lightfoot, BrightFarms:So I'm not the outcome measurement expert. And maybe Radhika could weigh in on this as well. I'll peg you as the expert, but it sounds pretty good to me. I mean, if you're growing on compost, your inputs, presumably don't have emissions associated with them. And then it depends on what other parts of your operations you're dealing with, like packaging and transportation. If you can find a way to offset that with agroforestry or other activities I think you're probably well on the way. I think Radhika would be interested if you had an opinion on that. It's an interesting question.
Radhika Moolgavkar, Nori:I think you kind of very well synopsized.t and Ben made these similar... Said something about how in other countries we lacked the modeling or the research or the... That is the barrier, oftentimes to bringing crops, at least into our system is that if there's not the scientific research behind it, we can't really tell you how much incremental carbon is being stored. Because it's just not there to tell us. So again, we know a lot of produce providers, suppliers who are doing all the right things, orchards. And right now the science isn't there within our model to help them come to the carbon marketplaces, which is unfortunate, and definitely seems like something that's eminently solvable with the right resources and right funding.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:I guess I would ask-
Paul Lightfoot, BrightFarms:That is one area, Vonnie, that the government can help. There's so much research to be done. And those are areas that I know you might have asked that at some point Vonnie. I generally believe in markets not government interventions. But that research is certainly needed.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:Yeah, so Martin do you see, I think as we look at the produce industry, it is so different than row crops and just doing cover crops, and no till, those systems probably aren't going to work as well. And so are there specific things that you think that the government can help the produce industry with? Or does it just fit into the different programs that you have broadly?
Martin Lowenfish, NRCS:Well, I'll have to answer somewhat broadly. And then so one in again, the Secretary's vision research is one of the elements. There's a seven point plan for the climate, smart agriculture and forestry and research is one of those pieces. I'll note also that at NRCS, we've been part of a consortium that's developed the comet tool that really works mostly on cropland. And that is something that's not proprietary. It's available on the website. And I know it's incorporated into a number of private industry partners and other partners.
Martin Lowenfish, NRCS:So we've been contributing to that research and provide information to producers as to the conservation systems and production systems that they've got in place. We can be a resource, or there's web resources for them to use that comet data. But like you were saying, I don't think it covers mushrooms or some of the other specialty crops right now. But certainly a focus on research for the broader climate smart agenda.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:Yeah, I think, as in a lot of these early types of things having some pre-competitive technology that gets done is a really great idea. And I think that's a great role of government is to have some of this pre-competitive technology density so we don't have a bunch of startups that are all doing the same thing. And we're diffusing the amount of capital that can be spent and invested in those types of things. And so that's where I love seeing these different programs where people can get funded, or we've got labs that are funded to do some of the pre-competitive work. Does a farmer who has been practicing good growing practices needs to demonstrate a delta in carbon capture in order to participate in the carbon market? It's a hot button. Ben, we'll let you start.
Ben Gordon, Corteva Agriscience:In most of the programs, yes, today. There are obviously some exceptions of how assets have been defined. I really think it comes down to what's the right asset for the right purpose. If we're talking offsets, that I think it's pretty no question. We need to make sure that there is that very hard and fast additionality.
Ben Gordon, Corteva Agriscience:I think there's a really big question that's still open in terms of, are there alternative assets where either because of consumer pull, financial pull, the things that Paul talked about, where a low carbon producer can get rewarded in another way, but maybe it's not going to be a carbon program. I come from North Dakota, my family, almost my whole team, like has family that are early adopters. We catch a lot of guff for it and I think it comes down to start with the money. Where it's coming from. Who is the buyer, whether that is the government down the road, or if it's just the end consumer, that's going to determine who's eligible. And so as Corteva we're not in the protocol writing business for it. Our job is to provide access, because we probably don't want input companies doing that in all reality. So I'd just say, start with the mind.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:Radhika, I'm sure you get this question all the time.
Radhika Moolgavkar, Nori:Yeah, and my answer would be very similar to Ben's. And we sincerely wish we could bring in producers who have been doing this for 20, 30, 40 years, because we know they've been doing the right thing for a long time. But we don't have people who want to purchase those carbon credits, unfortunately. The bottom line is people are interested in quote unquote, new carbon. And so we want to make sure we provide a product that is sellable, because if you're going to do all the work to put it into our system, we want to make sure you get the financial reward. Again, a place where potentially the federal government can play a role or other types of marketplaces can play a role but not a carbon removal marketplace, at least at this time.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:So do you all see this turning into a global market? I mean, it sounds like right now from what we're all talking about is more kind of US-based. But I know like Australia's really up in front on this and Europe's doing a lot of work on it. So do you think that it'll be a global market or that countries will kind of do their own thing for a while anyway.
Radhika Moolgavkar, Nori:Certainly, Nori's hope is a global market. That's kind of what we are, we are pushing towards and have, like I said, partners and investors who want us and want this to become a true global commodities market for carbon removal. It'll be an interesting next five years, as you look to the regulatory space to see how these different countries choose to regulate these different spaces and how you can then create a brand new commodities market in that system, but I think it's doable, and definitely should be the ultimate goal. Carbon doesn't know borders. So nor should the marketplace.
Paul Lightfoot, BrightFarms:I think some of those Australian projects have been bought by American companies. So it seems like it's already a global marketplace. I just think that our market is behind a lot of the world.
Ben Gordon, Corteva Agriscience:I think it's going to come down to the type of asset. I think you already see... In the offsets, you see it being more global, but more things will be tied to commodities. In some cases, it will be global. Look at the American Soybean Association, their sustainability protocol and that's driven a lot of sales to Europe or you have a more conscious consumer there. I think you'll see something similar and especially for your membership, I think it'll just kind of depend on the footprints that they're looking at. And again, who that end buyer is. Is it a big oil company or something like that, who's trying to buy an offset? Or are you tying it to the commodity or the end product itself to make a brand claim, or a carbon label claim to drive increased sales or meet a social commitment?
Vonnie Estes, PMA:What do you tell the American consumer and companies who say, why should we pay for reducing carbon emissions when China emits so much more and then competes with us in the marketplace? Getting into politics here. Anyone want to grab that one?
Paul Lightfoot, BrightFarms:Well, if nobody wants to I will. I mean, I always recommend people read Bill Gates's book, How to Avoid climate disaster, he lays out the fact that we emit as a society 51 billion tons a year. And it's like a bathtub filling up, we need to stop filling up the bathtub. We can only stop our part if they stop their part over there. So I think that the logic behind the question is flawed, in my opinion. Everybody has to stop, certainly, the US being behind a lot of developed world isn't helping the rest of the world move along faster.
Paul Lightfoot, BrightFarms:If we were ahead of them, I think it would help the rest of the world move along faster. And if we collaborated, that would be good as well. One of the things that not it's not talked about a lot is that I think poverty is a lot of the problem. You see farmers in other countries, engaging in destructive practices like burning rainforest, partly because they don't have better options, and they're living in poverty. Solving some of the world's poverty might be a helpful thing as well if we're talking about politics.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:There are 500 to 600 million acres of farmland and the same in forests and woodlands. Is specialty agriculture at a few million acres too small to make a significant contribution. Comparing the number of acres of grapes to the number of acres of corn.
Ben Gordon, Corteva Agriscience:I mean, I'd say there's two areas where specially I can perform in an outsized manner. One is their cropping systems related to certain specialty crops that can accrue a lot more on a per acre basis than broadacre row crops, especially where you have orchards, or similar systems. The second piece is you're a heck of a lot closer to the consumer than a soybean farmer. And so leading the charge on what Paul's talking about, I think is important for the broader industry. And if you look at organic as an example of driving change that has flowed to other sectors, it's important. So if impacts what you're looking for I don't think I have a significant concern if I was in your membership's shoes.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:That's a great answer. Thank you. Anyone else?
Paul Lightfoot, BrightFarms:Can I offer an another answer, Vonnie. This one comes from a different angle, I think. I was in Iceland a couple months ago, and I visited a greenhouse farm, that all of its heat was from geothermal and all its electricity was hydro dam. There's just no fossil fuels involved with their production at all. And half the cars being sold their electric already. And so they are producing food in a controlled environment renewably without a carbon footprint.
Paul Lightfoot, BrightFarms:It seems to me that it's inexorable will be that way in the United States, we will find a way to electrify everything, we will find a way to make all of electricity, renewable. And there is a case where you can take some of the farmland in California, that's growing fruits and vegetables, move some of that to controlled environments in areas of the country where the soil isn't so uniquely fabulous and the climate isn't so great. And repurpose that for producing food in a carbon negative way.
Paul Lightfoot, BrightFarms:Maybe some more pasture land for regenerative beef, maybe some perennials, like olives or something. And then you've got a chance to repurpose parts of that farmland, your questioner asked about, to be levers pulling carbon out of the atmosphere. So I think that... And by the way a couple million is a small percentage of a couple 100 million. But we got to get all of it taken care of. And we got to start from the beginning. One at a time. What do they say about the starfish, you throw back in the ocean, it mattered to this one.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:All right, I actually think that is an excellent place to stop. And I really appreciate your views. And you all sit in different parts of this whole system. And I'm excited that conversations like these are happening and that we're... We're trying to change the system here. And I think a lot of people who are working in carbon, think of it as a tool or a technology, but we really are trying to change the big system. And we need all these different pieces of it for it to work. So thank you for your engagement and thank you for the work that you do.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:I loved how this conversation spanned the system where change needs to happen from government involvement through technology development, and business model development to consumer demand. I said in the beginning of the podcast, I had a listener that still had the question what in it for the produce industry. How does this fit into what we are doing? That listeners Greg Johnson from the Produce Blue Book, I really appreciated that he followed up on this after the webinar and continued to try to break it down for his readers.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:I suggest you Google his article and read all of it. But his basic summary of why the produce industry should care about the carbon economy are three major points. One, consumers are asking for it. Just like consumers have started to place a priority on wanting to know food companies sustainability levels, interest in carbon impact is also on the rise. Two carbon reduction fits in well with sustainability efforts and improves growing practices. So these practices will improve soils and profitability in the long run. Three, growers can make money by removing carbon. Numerous programs are being developed through the government and private enterprise to compensate growers for storing carbon. All of this is new and it's really complex. But the carbon economy is certainly something the produce industry will be involved in. Stay tuned.

JANUARY 16, 2019
1. Look for your pain points and be willing to change.Each business is different, and while we share some common pain points, others may be more specific. A technology solution that meets the needs of one type of operation may be useless to another. Sometimes we get so busy running the day-to-day operations of our businesses, we don’t take the time to look at the business environment around us. What are the new trends? What’s the competition doing? What do my customers want? What are my business needs? Step back, examine your business and find your true pain points.
The second gift you can give yourself is to be open to change. It’s human nature to be uncertain of change, or to even fear it. But in this ever-competitive environment we work in, chances are, you are going to have to change your operations. In fact, that’s really what this is about: making changes that render your operation more cost effective, sustainable, efficient, and better suited to meet your customers’ needs.
Only one certainty – if you don’t continue to evolve your business, others will make those changes and you could find yourself out of business.
2. Develop awareness of technologies, develop connections and engage with entrepreneurs and vendors.Find sources of information. Connect with entrepreneurs and start-ups. And don’t forget about established technology and service providers who are offering new opportunities, upgraded technology products and services. Lastly, engage. Trade associations and universities are always providing opportunities to engage. Go to demonstrations, work with technology providers to test equipment and develop a sense of whether that technology product is a solution to your pain point.
3. Evaluate your current systems and map where you want to go.Ever stand back in your field, packinghouse, processing plant or distribution facility and just watch? Is what you see efficient? Do you have too many workers, or too few? Does the product flow evenly or stop and start? Does the product move from one part of the operation to another to create efficiencies? Do you have equipment that can generate digital data? Can you collect and analyze that data? Can pieces of equipment communicate with each other?
What measures do you currently have in place to help you identify where you might get better? Can you measure how much each step costs you? Are there cost savings there? What are the financial implications (cost of capital versus operational costs, ROI, opportunity to increase business, threat of business loss to competition)?
Are your production processes choreographed like a ballet, or do they look like a crowd exiting a football stadium going every which way? You need to map your process. Identify where you should make changes to improve efficiencies, quality, safety. Identify the priorities and know what your timelines and resources are.
4. Check upstream and downstream. You have to think of what you are doing as a process. You want to build in efficiencies; not move your problems upstream or downstream from your new technology. Components of your process all need to work together. If one operation works faster than another, then you just build up behind that step and you don’t really gain any speed, efficiency or cost savings. Check upstream and downstream of where you want to make a change. You need to synchronize steps so they work together and the whole process gains speed, cost savings, and more consistency.
You have to think of controlling and improving the whole process, whatever your production process might be.
5. Adopting a new technology has costs.There are a variety of ways to understand what those costs are. You can look at the cost of the new equipment and add in installation. There also may be some business disruption costs because you have to assume some decline in productivity while the new system or process gets up and running. There are training costs to learn how to use the new technology, and there might be ongoing data collection and analytics costs and so on. Don’t forget that if you invest in this technology, it might mean that you lose the opportunity to invest elsewhere in your business. And, of course, somewhere in the process, you need to determine what success would look like to you and then consider your probabilities of attaining success.
Hand in hand with that analysis, you also have to look at the upsides. What new opportunities might come your way as a result of the investment? Can you retain current customers? Can you gain new customers? Can you expand your capacity? Can you develop new product lines? Can you reduce input costs, such as energy or water? What might happen if you don’t invest? Can you stay competitive? What is the time horizon for your business?
6. Selecting your supplier or vendor is always important.When you buy a car, price is always important, but most of us look for information on how other owners have fared with that model. We might talk with our neighbors or relatives, or check the internet and other sources for information. We might shop around a bit and look at alternatives.
We always look at service. Do they have a good track record? Do they have the parts? Do they have the knowledge and mechanics? Does the shop have long waiting lists for appointments? How far are they away from my home?
We have to go through the same process when selecting a provider for a new technology. Your new technology is going to require modifications, it will break down, and it will be upgraded. Can your provider give you that service? Do they have the parts and the expertise? Can they train your staff? What is their track record? Having the right supplier makes implementation easier.
7. Implement.Implementation might be one of the hardest things to do. It often means operational disruption and it is hard to turn back. It can sometimes mean running in parallel streams. For example: implementing a mechanized harvester might mean using the machine but continuing to use a harvest crew for a certain time period because you can’t be out of product. Changing a packing line into an automated line might entail the same. Chances are, the introduction of the automated line will take some time to perfect, and you have orders to make so you run in parallel.
This is also where any asynchronies will show up, i.e. where one part of your process might outstrip another unexpectedly.
Training is critical – how do you use the equipment, and what do you do about people issues? Do you have the talent to run more sophisticated equipment? How about sanitation challenges and food safety issues? Does the technology change the product? Are you communicating with your customers?
8. Assess and fine tune.Nobody gets it exactly right the first time. Part of defining success is choosing the appropriate measurements to assess that progress. You might need outside expertise to assist. Choose vendors that can help.
Assessment can be both operational (workflow, labor, product quality) and financial. Are you achieving the efficiencies you sought?

Vonnie Estes, PMA:Welcome to PMA Takes On Tech. The podcast that explores the problems, solutions, people, and ideas that are shaping the future of the produce industry. I'm your host, Vonnie Estes vice president of technology for the Produce Marketing Association. And I've spent years in the Ag-tech sector. So I can attest, it's hard to navigate this ever-changing world in developing and adopting new solutions to industry problems. Thanks for joining us and for allowing us to serve as your guide to the new world of produce and technology. My goal of the podcast is to outline a problem in the produce industry and then discuss several possible solutions that can be deployed today.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:This episode of PMA takes on tech is sponsored by CropTrak. CropTrak helps food and beverage companies improve their supply chain management from contracts, all growing activities, sustainability, and ESG management to grower settlements. To learn how your entire supply chain operations can work more efficiently, go to CropTrak.com\PMA. Welcome to today's episode with Randy Pequignot, a field supervisor of Snap Beans in Illinois with Del Monte. He has been at this job for 26 years and with Del Monte for 30 years. So he knows his stuff.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:If you want to hear how folks in the field are thinking about data management and adopting technology, Randy is your guy. It's so important for people who are developing technology to hear from people like Randy. He talks about what the needs are in data management from the field perspective, how data is used? What form it needs to be in, and that it needs to play well with other data. He also talks about the journey of adopting technology. This is truly a boots on the ground conversation.
Randy Pequignot, Del Monte:Hello, my name's Randy Pequignot, and I'm a field supervisor with Del Monte Foods here in North America, and based out of Central Illinois. And being a field supervisor, my main task is contracting and raising Snap Beans for canning purposes. I've been a field supervisor with Del Monte for, this is my 26th year as a field supervisor. It's my 30th year as a Del Monte employee counting some seasonal years before becoming a field supervisor.
Randy Pequignot, Del Monte:So we grow and raise snap beans, early source and late source here in Illinois for our production facilities in Wisconsin. And an auxiliary part of my job is we accumulate all of our Ag data from starting the crop, contracting, all the way through, till it's being dumped at the plant. So for traceability and sustainability processes through the whole growing season, we use this platform for everything we need to do.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:And how long have you been using that technology for?
Randy Pequignot, Del Monte:I've been working for about seven years. The last three years has been our main jump into going full board. We run from like I say, contracting all the way through payment. And so we do electronic contracts. We're able to schedule our [plantings 00:04:05] And keep track of all the scouting's and sprays and everything in a one place live environment. So everybody can keep up with it live basically, real time.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:Did you jump into using it for all those different things at the very beginning and/or have you incrementally used different parts of the platform as time has gone on?
Randy Pequignot, Del Monte:Incrementally different parts of the platform as time has went on. We first started in with just as a mapping program and have moved up, stair stepped with them. As they've grew, we have grew with them in parts of the platform that they offer. One of the biggest things that we use and I guess goes along with the climate situation is weather data. And so our older system that we did use, we would collect weather data on basically one or two weather stations in a 60 mile area. We can get it down to a two mile grid and basically we're collecting weather data on a per field basis instead of a per 60 square mile area.
Randy Pequignot, Del Monte:So that is helping us be able to schedule our plantings to in the end run, have our harvest come off in a streamlined a way where the plant stays full and we're not over-producing or under-producing on a daily basis.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:So how are you thinking about managing supply chain efficiencies, now in 2021, after all the changes that we've experienced?
Randy Pequignot, Del Monte:From the field side of it, weather's the biggest player for us and it comes down to a lot of, with the newer technology out there, it's helping us schedule a lot more, scheduled better, more I should say. And that's really, it's really helping us in the long run in that way.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:Yeah, like you were just saying, as far as getting, having the right amount of product, get in to the plant, to the processing plant, that kind of scheduling, it really helps with efficiencies, right?
Randy Pequignot, Del Monte:Yes. Naturally we don't want to overproduce and not be able to get it canned and we don't want to under produce and run short on days at the facilities.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:Yeah. There are many data tools available to help farmers manage their operations. What is the most important to you for a data solution?
Randy Pequignot, Del Monte:Being in the veg industry, I mean, there's a lot of data platforms out there and in the veg industry, it's kind of, there's a lot of corn and soybean platforms out there but the veg industry-
Vonnie Estes, PMA:There sure are.
Randy Pequignot, Del Monte:Yes. But the veg industry you really, I mean, we do things different than the corn and soybean guys and to have a platform that's dedicated to you. There's just not that many out there. To us or another user they're not the same. It's the same base canvas, but it's totally customized in basically the language that we use in our business practice instead of just a generic program.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:In the using and adopting, there must have been a lot of back and forth of you explaining what you needed and then them iterating and making changes. And then you trying that, was there a lot of that kind of cycling that happened?
Randy Pequignot, Del Monte:Yes, there was.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:Yeah. I was talking to a couple of the people at the company and they were saying that everybody's, a lot of their customers, they use different languages for, different words to describe things. And so they kept having to change things because people in one part of the country or would use a different language to explain something. And so that keeps them on their toes, I think.
Randy Pequignot, Del Monte:It does. Yeah, we have run into many little things like that, even in other Del Monte locations. Weeds are called different things. I mean, it's the same weed, but they have a different name or a bug has that, is the same bug, but it has a different name in different locations of the US. So we've run across that just internally.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:So you talked about weather information, but what kinds of other information do you need real time to manage your supply chain?
Randy Pequignot, Del Monte:So we do electronic tickets, field tickets. So we know in real time when the truck is in the field, it's being loaded. It's loaded in, on the road, it's arrived at the plant. It's been weighed in/ it's basically on deck to be dumped. So all those steps are real time, so we can have an idea how many loads we need to be picking. Do we need to slow down a little bit, speed up a little bit, to keep the plant full of product?
Vonnie Estes, PMA:How many acres do you have? Is it all in the same spot or is it spread out over the Midwest? Or are you mostly in Illinois in a certain locale?
Randy Pequignot, Del Monte:I'm based out of Central Illinois, but I mean, we have locations in the state of Washington, California, Oregon, Wisconsin, and Illinois.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:And they all have someone with a role like yours? And is there one plant per each of those locations or are you driving to different facilities?
Randy Pequignot, Del Monte:All of my product goes to our two facilities in Wisconsin, our two bean facilities. The main bean growing area is in central Wisconsin, corn and peas is in Washington, and fruit is in California and also in Washington. So yes, at all those locations there is people just like me in the, as field supervisors, working with the growers on a day-to-day basis of producing the best quality crop we can with the least amount of inputs to grow that crop.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:And are these contract growers or are they... How does that framework work? Are they growers that work for Del Monte or are they growers that then sell to Del Monte?
Randy Pequignot, Del Monte:Contracts growers.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:Okay. Very cool. So looking at climate related stresses, how is Del Monte responding to the impact of climate related stresses on your farm operations or the supply chain overall?
Randy Pequignot, Del Monte:Varietal is a big one for us on the field side. Del Monte, 90 plus percent of the beans that we grow are Del Monte's known varieties. And bred for the color, quality and taste that that is a Del Monte bean. And we're always looking, our breeders are always looking for new traits in our bean varieties that will help with basically... Like I said before, weather is a big player is, in our harvest ability and growing the beans is we want an upright bush to keep the airflow down between the rows.
Randy Pequignot, Del Monte:So if we do get some rains, they will dry out, but you want enough canopy that will shade the weeds. And then the upright bush will keep the beans up off the ground even if you get a heavy storm, it not totally but it'll help keep the beans up off the ground, which helps in quality issues. And then bring in disease packages. So we could spray less and so forth.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:Where is the breeding done for the beans?
Randy Pequignot, Del Monte:Wisconsin is where our been grow, our been breeders are located. We grow a lot of the seed out in Washington, state of Washington, lot of push to increase nodulation on our varieties to use less fertilizer and so forth.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:And are you seeing more extreme weather or any changes in weather? Have you seen a change over the last couple of years?
Randy Pequignot, Del Monte:Yeah. I would have to say yeah, the weather patterns seem to be a bigger swings in the weather patterns. It just don't seem like we can get a nice all day inch rain anymore. If it's going to rain, we'll get a big storm and it'll rain for 15, 20 minutes and you'll get half inch to an inch. Which, I mean, everybody loves a rain, but sometimes when a rain comes that fast and furious, it doesn't get a chance to soak in and you get run off and you're not getting the value out of that rain. And then naturally with the storms you got, hail, wind and other things that bring in diseases and works only on the quality side of it.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:Yeah. So are you breeding for more drought tolerance? Do they need to be more drought tolerant because you're getting less rain or is that a problem?
Randy Pequignot, Del Monte:No, everything we grow is irrigated so.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:Yeah. So you can get the amount of water that you need?
Randy Pequignot, Del Monte:Yep.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:Yeah. So how do you think the company will manage environmental stresses going forward?
Randy Pequignot, Del Monte:I think with technology that's out there it has really improved what we've done, and like I say, our bean breeding program has really brought a lot to the party to help us, obtain those goals of a steady supply chain in the culture we're in right now with the weather and climate and so forth.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:Do you grow different types of varieties in your particular area or/and do you get new varieties every year or how does the varieties change?
Randy Pequignot, Del Monte:Well, we grow a couple of three different varieties. And we're always looking at new varieties that our breeders cross up. And it's awful tough, you'll find a variety that has one great trait, but it's a little lacking on a couple of other traits. And you might find a sister variety to it that's brings something to the party, but is lacking there also.
Randy Pequignot, Del Monte:So it's tough to find that one variety that brings everything you need to be a success. So we look at many, many varieties and usually pick two or three a year to push forward to see how they're going to react in different locations also. So what works well in Wisconsin might not work well here in Illinois.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:Or it might work well this year, but it doesn't work as well next year.
Randy Pequignot, Del Monte:Definitely. Thus, you definitely want to look at it over a two three-year period.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:And did the breeders come and interact with you and look and see how things are going in the field for data and feedback as well?
Randy Pequignot, Del Monte:Yes. Yes. Yep. We interact with them all year long, looking at trials and trying their new varieties and taking harvest measurements and growing qualities all through the growing season. So we talk back and forth with them, what we see on the Ag side that can be improved on or what is working well?
Vonnie Estes, PMA:And are you thinking about, or managing different factors for different crops like tomatoes versus carrots, versus peaches, for instance.
Randy Pequignot, Del Monte:Not too much difference. I mean, in the big picture, they're all in the same boat with weather patterns, it's all relevant that via drought, heavy rain storms, it's all going to affect all the crops we do in the same way.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:So what is the biggest change produce farmers will face in the next two years or beyond?
Randy Pequignot, Del Monte:I would say weather, probably the number one and help is going to be number two, is another big hurdle.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:Definitely.
Randy Pequignot, Del Monte:So you can have all the technology in the world, but sometimes they don't get the manual labor done.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:Yeah, exactly. How is Del Monte working with your farmers to mitigate those particular challenges?
Randy Pequignot, Del Monte:We're able to, like I said before, drill that weather data down and we get daily weather reports. I mean, we don't have to go out and see where it did rain. We can get that on a, in a real-time basis. That's going to help us manage when to water, when not to water? Fertilizer when to fertilize and when not to fertilize behind a big rain.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:If you were to talk to someone who hadn't adopt these types of tools, what kind of things would you tell them to make their journey easier in adopting technology? And should they adopt new technology?
Randy Pequignot, Del Monte:I would always say, yes. Moving on the technology is a great thing. Like a lot of other things it's not cheap, and there's a lot of things out there. Is your return on investment going to be there? Jury's still out on that.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:Would you look at that over a season or over a year, two years or over a decade? How do you look at it, evaluate your return on investment on those types of tools?
Randy Pequignot, Del Monte:Well, some of that's yes, you got to look at the long-term, but some of the short term stuff, there's some water management tools out there that they would be great tools in heavier ground when to water, but in some of our sandier soils it's not when or water, it's when you can shut the water off. And so I guess it doesn't need to tell you when to water and that cost yeah, can be a pretty steep cost comparative to water, but everybody wants to save as much valuable resource of water that you can, so it's kind of a fine line in there. But data collection is great. I mean, you can collect all your data, run your numbers and then do some great comparisons in number crunching to get you where it is a return on investment or not.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:Yeah, I think one of the things I wonder about it is how deep do you have to get into a system before you figure out whether it has a good return on investment or not. I mean, you have to spend a lot of time to learn water management, any kind of data, farming management system, you have to spend your time to try to figure it out. So when you're looking at something, how do you make the decision of I'm going to go ahead and try that, this and see if it works and see if I get a return on investment.
Randy Pequignot, Del Monte:Yeah. I would say yeah, you can't do it. You can't look at it at a one year deal and going to see that return, because it is a big investment and a large step forward. But I would say time savings for us has been one of the huge additions and accessibility to all the information. I mean, prior to having this platform, where we all have it at our fingertips basically. The data prior to that is if you needed a piece of data, you try to get ahold of somebody and they had to look it up in their three ring binder.
Randy Pequignot, Del Monte:And then you get the information and then pass it on to the person that needs it. But like I say, now with real time data, it's there. Anybody can use it from the plant side of it for quality issues that they're seeing or could be seeing to spray records, and scouting records, and planting records, and it's just all right there.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:And you're all seeing it, all the people in those different roles that are making decisions. You're all seeing the same data at the same time, right?
Randy Pequignot, Del Monte:Exactly.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:Yeah, that's fascinating. What was it like to go from the three ring binder to everybody having the same data? I mean, did that take a long time for people to figure out how do we work together on this and trust it, or was that pretty fast?
Randy Pequignot, Del Monte:It was pretty fast. I mean, like everything else, you're always going to have the naysayers that are going to buck change and there's... We thought it might be some of the older folks, but a fair share of the older folks took onto it more than maybe some of the middle-aged ones.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:Oh, that's interesting.
Randy Pequignot, Del Monte:Yeah. It surprised me. But no, it actually went pretty fast and pretty well. And it's making everybody's job easier. So I mean, that's a big hurdle. I mean, if we can make our jobs easier, you can get home maybe a little earlier in the day than 12, 14 hours, it might be 10 hour days. So it does. And maybe a lot of times, a lot less phone calls. ""Well, I need this. I need that."" Well, all they have to do now is just look it up. It's right there at your finger tips.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:And it also I assume, allows you to make some real time decisions instead of sometimes when you get data that is already two weeks old or stale, you're looking backwards and you're not able to make real time decisions in the moment of what to do and what to change.
Randy Pequignot, Del Monte:Most definitely. And like I said, with the harvest side of things, it has really been a great thing on the real-time data. So they can see, we have CropTrak linked up with a system we use in the facilities and we can actually see what they're processing in tons per hour. And we can see as us harvesting, are we harvesting enough, are we not harvesting enough? And we can relay quality issues with all that information. So the plant knows, ""Hey, there's some brown spot on these beans, maybe they need to slow down and clean them up a little better."" So all that being real time where before is, ""Yeah, you had to relay that and they had to make sure it got relayed to the right person."" So all that is incorporated in the plant, their screens around, gives them all that data on a real time platform.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:Yeah, that's great. So you can respond to it happening now. You had mentioned that it was tied in with another system in your plant. And one of the complaints I hear about so many of these systems is people have old legacy systems and then they get some new app or something and nothing talks to each other. And so it sounds like in this situation that you've got two different systems that are able to communicate with each other, have you found that to be the case a lot with technology, or has that been a problem?
Randy Pequignot, Del Monte:No. So far everything that we use internally has linked very well. We use some different platforms for... Our aerial applicators use some of their own platforms and we can link directly with them. So it's been a lot of time savings of, instead of having to put it into three different programs, you put it into one and we can pick it up or send it to any of the others.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:Yeah. Great. Well, is there anything else you want to mention about just adopting technology and what that journey has been like, or you think we've kind of got it covered?
Randy Pequignot, Del Monte:I think we kind of got to covered. Yeah, it's definitely a journey. And like I said, jumping over the last 25 years of handwritten notes and trying to find where you wrote it down and when you wrote it down what you did? To being able to document it right now on the iPad or iPhone or your desktop, if you're at the office and having that live data real time is very valuable.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:Great. Well, thank you very much for your time, Randy. I really appreciate it.
Randy Pequignot, Del Monte:You're welcome.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:Randy touched on so many important things about adopting a data platform. Every operation is different and vegetables are certainly different from corn and soy. So we need to start with a platform that is tailored to our growing systems. Then a close collaboration with the tech provider, especially at this early stage of technology development is crucial. Use of the technology is iterative and both the developer and the customer need to work together. Maybe in the future, a company can just sell a platform, but we aren't there yet.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:So all platform companies need to have a consultant part of their company. It is an integral part of the product, not an extra pain. And how do we measure return on investment? As we use tools that look at increased efficiencies in the chain, we will be able to see increases in yields and decreases in costs of production from data management systems over time. For Randy, the biggest ROI to him is getting several hours of his day back and not constantly looking for those scraps of paper or binders.

Vonnie Estes:Welcome to PMA Takes on Tech. The podcast that explores the problems, solutions, people, and ideas that are shaping the future of the produce industry. I'm your host, Vonnie Estes, Vice President of Technology for the Produce Marketing Association. And I've spent years in the AgTech sector. So I can attest, it's hard to navigate this ever-changing world in developing and adopting new solutions to industry problems. Thanks for joining us and for allowing us to serve as your guide to the new world of produce and technology. My goal of the podcast is to outline a problem in the produce industry and then discuss several possible solutions that can be deployed today.
This episode of PMA Takes on Tech is sponsored by CropTrak. CropTrak helps companies digitize their unique supply chains and break down data silos. Whether it's data about crops, contracts, operations, or carbon CropTrak offers an easy way to manage data needed for tracking, tracing or transparency. To learn more, go to CropTrak.com\PMA.
As many of our listeners are keenly aware the race to develop systems for carbon capture and reduction is on. Today we're going to dig deeper into the carbon challenge and talk to two innovators who are working with food companies to ensure transparency across the supply chain. Joining me today is Dave Stangis, who is the former Chief Sustainability Officer at Campbell Soup and founder of 21C Impact and Anthony Kingsley, head of ESG, which is Environmental, Social, and Governance and Impact for Benson Hill. Welcome to each of you.
Dave Stangis:Thanks so much.
Vonnie Estes:Dave, tell us more about your background and the work that you're up to now.
Dave Stangis:Yeah, thanks Vonnie. It's great to be here and great to be with you, Anthony. I think this is the time we've met virtually, but I've been following some of the work, you and your company. My background is I would say, it started in core Environmental Health and Safety. I spent more than a decade at Intel Corporation where I created their sustainability and ESG strategy, clearly different than food. In 2008, Campbell asked me to come and join them to create their first version of this. The food sector was a little bit later in mass than the tech sector. And was there, again for a little over a decade and worked on sustainability as well as responsible sourcing and sustainable agriculture and some of the public affairs and reputation programs. And for the last couple of years, I've been advising companies across sectors. Some big food companies, some very small, startup even, food companies, but also companies that are in different sectors in life sciences or finance or tech as well. So I'm having a lot of fun and I'm cutting across a lot of these topics we're going to talk about.
Vonnie Estes:So what services are you providing for your clients?
Dave Stangis:Primarily it's advising on strategy. So most of these companies are at some point along the maturity curve of ESG or sustainability, and they're either starting, they may be getting questions from investors if they're private companies or they may be getting investors or questions from institutional investors and other stakeholders of their great big public companies. Some are well on the path and they're just looking to amplify or actually integrate this into their business functions, whether it's HR or marketing or procurement. So they're across the board. And mainly I sit as a extended member of their leadership team just to help accelerate that progress.
Vonnie Estes:That makes sense. Anthony, you recently joined Benson Hill as impact and ESG Director. Tell us more about your role and your focus there.
Anthony Kingsle:Yeah. Thanks. So same, Dave. Great to meet and great to hear about your work as well. So Benson Hill, we are a food technology company that combines food science, data science, and plant science leveraging the natural genetic diversity of plants to produce more nutritious and sustainable foods that really address consumer demand. Especially from those millennials and Gen Zs. We're really focused on developing products that are better optimized from the seed level to really help meet this demand. And so I joined Benson Hill in January and it just really attracted me, I think because they're so focused on innovation and not only for themselves, but enabling innovation throughout the food industry as well. And that was just very, very appealing to me. And then of course they have what we call a closed loop strategy that provides us insights at each of the stages of the value chain.
So working with growers, working with processors, working with retailers and CPGs really provides just a very unique look at the entire supply chain as a whole. And so I thought that was just super interesting and of course their focus and their purpose for existing is to provide nutritious, sustainable, and healthy foods and provide greater access to those foods and ingredients as well. So, I'm just really, really happy to have joined Benson Hills at such a great time.
Vonnie Estes:People listening, there may be people that don't know Benson Hill, which would be surprising, but there could be, but it's a company that has grown really quickly in the last couple of years that I've watched really prosper and do well. So was this a new role? Are you the first person to have this role? And was it a new role that was created?
Anthony Kingsle:Yeah, so I am the first person to hold this role, but as I said the purpose of Benson Hill is really to develop sustainable, healthy and nutritious foods. I think bringing myself on board was an opportunity to really formalize and solidify all the great work that had already been put in place and really build a more strategic and intentional approach around it as we continue to grow as an organization.
Vonnie Estes:Which is how companies grow. That's great.
Anthony Kingsle:Yeah, part of that sustainability journey curve, I think that Dave mentioned earlier.
Vonnie Estes:Yeah, exactly. So Dave, in your work, you talk with many food industry executives. I'm curious about your perspective on the recent reports claiming that supply chain disruptions during COVID will be nothing compared to those from climate change. What are you hearing about that?
Dave Stangis:Yeah, there's some truth to that. I would say, I think that the challenge with the COVID related supply chain disruptions is they were not seen, they were not anticipated in the way they played out. They came up so quick. Everybody might've had global pandemic on their risk map, but it was way out in the fourth quadrant. So, they're going to be different. I think that the shifts and the impact that we're going to see from climate change across the food supply chain, but a lot of other supply chains as well, both from physical risks that people understand, sea level rise and other things like this or disasters and hurricanes and weather, but also the transition risk and not being prepared to manage technology transitions like Anthony is describing in agriculture, but also other shifts that come with electrification and the analytics at the farm level, these are huge disruptions.
The good thing is that they are visible. Everybody may not be reacting to them in the same way, but they're at least there and people are working on them and they can start to plan now. The bad thing is they're going to be life-changing for some of these people in the value chain. They're going to change careers, they're going to change skill sets needed, and they're definitely going to change the way food is produced, delivered and communicated about.
Vonnie Estes:Anthony. What do you think? And looking at this and the climate change disruptions.
Anthony Kingsle:Yeah, Dave, I think what you mentioned is spot on. And I would think of it really in two pieces. One is that resilience, what can we do to continue to prepare for the changes that we'll see when the IPCC report came out a couple of weeks back, it was very clear and evident that climate change is happening, it's happening today. And we'll continue to feel the impacts in many different ways. And then the second piece being, it doesn't have to be as bad as it could. If we continue to mitigate, to see organizations, industries, government policies being sent around the different commitments, we see a lot of private sector companies focused on long range, sustainability and GHG reduction commitments. So, I think both of these, having the resilience, having the mitigation coming together and really being able to avoid some of those worst case scenarios is certainly an opportunity for us. And I think the food industry is poised to contribute in a very significant way.
Vonnie Estes:Yeah, I think having people with roles like yours or companies like yours, David, this is front and center and that those 10 years ago, people like you, weren't in leadership conversations. And so I think that makes a big difference too. So, kind of pivoting to carbon, there's so much talk about carbon capture and sequestration in Ag and even some programs out there for payment, mostly in broadacre crops. Anthony is Benson Hill developing or participating in carbon capture or credit programs with your partners.
Anthony Kingsle:Yeah, that's a great question. So in short, yes we are. We're very interested in carbon. So, at Benson Hill we have a proprietary technology platform that we call CropOS, Crop Operating System. And this system combines large scale, data analytics and artificial intelligence with plant biology and food science to produce crops that are optimized for taste and nutrition. Now, big data, essentially, predictive analytics and machine learning are things that are being used and delivered across different industries. Now by harnessing this we're able to simulate breeding outcomes and produce crops that again, are really optimized for certain characteristics, for example, such as protein content. So engaging with our growers in that way, collecting data, leveraging on farm technology is really important. And a key piece of that is how are we measuring carbon?
How are we measuring our greenhouse gas impact and output on those farms? And so just this year, we've become members of the ESMC, the Ecosystem Service Market Consortium. And they're very focused on producing a carbon market and actually water quality market as well. And so as part of that membership, we're very engaged and working through how we can prepare our growers and our farmers for entering into that type of carbon credit market and data and technology and understanding what's happening at the field level is a critical component of making that happen.
Vonnie Estes:So what types of programs are either of you seeing that might work in the produce industry? I know that this isn't really your focus, but Dave in some of the work that you've done, Campbell type companies, what are you seeing? What are each of you seeing in that area that might work?
Dave Stangis:Yeah, I think that the parameters that Anthony just described are the consistent themes that have to come through with this. So a lot of what is happening in agriculture around carbon is better agricultural practices that focus on healthier soils and carbon sequestration. All that is great for the farm, it's great for nutrition, it's great for the environment, but it needs to be measured and it needs to be accounted for in order to put it into a trading program. So the data is really key and the same type of systems you put in place around tracking and measurement. The hardest thing is really getting down to the measurement of the sequestration to the change in the carbon, in the soil. How long has it in there? Can I account for it? Then, can I assure it and monetize it? That's been the challenge.
Campbell looked at a couple offset programs in rice in the past and companies are clearly they're doing forestry. You've seen this play out all over the place, but it's the same technology if you're in produce. For the same ranges of topics, got to have the data, you got to be able to measure the change, got to be able to measure the timeline and then account for it. So if I'm in the produce sector, I'm thinking about it the same way that Anthony described in his sector. It's more difficult, I would say because there hasn't been as much piloting going on in produce. And the other thing is, I think it's just the way the customers, a lot of this has pulled up through the value chain and up by brands up by publicly traded companies, making carbon commitments that sometimes the produce line, frankly, where it goes in the food system and where it goes up, the brand chain is a little bit different than some of the row crops. But generally,
Vonnie Estes:And you see that as a positive? Because a brand would be able to say, it'd be able to say that this is carbon neutral or however they want to phrase it as a branding thing. Does that make it more positive for produce, you think?
Dave Stangis:Yes, and what I think is sometimes produce may be challenged because there may not be a lot of brands that are stamped on produce. There are a few, and we know the ones that there are, but the way these programs work is you're looking for value across a bunch of channels. There's a value in carbon reporting, there's a value to the brand, perhaps in marketing, there's a value in reputation. Somebody is going to be paying for the pilot and paying for the work. So you're looking to spread that brand value out if you can. And definitely if I'm a company that can take credit for it authentically, transparently in my product, I'm going to take credit for it. And some of the attributes that Anthony has talked about in his products as well. Whether it's nutritious, more sustainable, carbon's a great way to start in a great data piece to go after.
Anthony Kingsle:Yeah, I might just add onto that as well. I very much agree. And I would think of this as really two ends of the value chain that are working harmoniously. So on the one hand we want to work with our growers and enable them to improve their soil health. It's something that a lot of growers are focused on and we want to help enable that. Now, part of doing that is the potential to sequester carbon. So through implementation of some of these agricultural and conservation practices they're able to achieve improved soil health. And as a byproduct, their carbon sequestration can then potentially be monetized as carbon credits. And what's nice is then when you turn in position to customers and consumers, yes, you can definitely bring that story through and provide the sustainability marketing, the sustainability storytelling around what the growers can do and how we are providing ingredients or providing foods that have such a great nutritious, reduced carbon emission and healthy story around it. So I think these two components really work hand in hand with one another.
Vonnie Estes:Yeah. I think in talking to a lot of the producers in our industry, I've heard a number of them say that focusing on carbon is really not the right place to focus, that we really should be focusing more on healthy soil. Like you mentioned, because that, if you develop a healthy soil, you're going to get return on investment. And so a lot of the practices that sequester or capture carbon, are the same as going to give you healthy soil.
Right now, we did a think-tank with a bunch of producers talking about this. And they basically, some of them felt like they were missing out. They're like, okay, everyone else is getting money and I'm not getting money. Like how do I get money? But a lot of them just said, look, this is part of the practices that we do for healthy soils. And so we don't expect to get money. So, if you were talking to a group of growers, would you say that the soil is the most important thing or that it's a two component thing?
Dave Stangis:Yeah, I can give you my 2 cents. Sorry, Anthony. I don't think that we're talking about two different completely things. I have actually been asked by investors looking to set up the investment screen several years ago, about how to manage or how to assess these companies that were taking claims about healthier soil, frankly. One of the ways you do that is measure carbon content. So, healthy soil is the, I would say the north star. That's what we're looking for, but in order to take credit for it, in order to monetize, you have to measure something and maybe you measure organic content, which is carbon, or you measure water or a reduction in certain things. So I think that instead what either or, a lot of advice I would give is, look at carbon as a measurement to drive and to assess soil health.
Anthony Kingsle:Yeah, I very much agree with that. And I think to your point, Dave, it makes sense at the field level too. Because the end goal is for us to produce foods that have nutritional content. That have good yield. And so soil health is a key component of doing that. I think what helps drive growers or farmers toward that outcome as well is when there are food system, I'll call them enablers that are happening. Such as, okay, I'm doing this practices already and now that I can measure it, there's the potential for additional revenue through carbon credits. We're seeing even this Congress right now, the Growing Climate Solutions Act was passed by the Senate, so the ability, again, an enabler through the government to potentially help farmers and ranchers to set up a carbon market, we're seeing a lot of talk from the SEC and Mr. Gensler right now on ensuring that there's better regulation on the SG. So I think all these enablers are going to help motivate and push the food system in this direction.
Vonnie Estes:So when you look forward, how do you think this is going to evolve? Like, in two years, Anthony, do you think that there'll be more programs in place and farmers will be getting paid or, right now it's a little, all fools rush in. It's like everybody, use my program, no use my program. And it's really kind of hard to figure out how to go about this. So how do you see it evolving?
Anthony Kingsle:Yeah. That's a great question. My guess would be that we will start to see a little bit more policy around it that we'll start to see more, these private-public partnership, like the SNC, for example, who will begin, or at least help to frame a little bit more quantification and more standards around where this is going to go. So, I would suspect that we'll start to see that.
Vonnie Estes:Dave, what do you think?
Dave Stangis:Yeah, I agree. The other thing I would add, I agree a hundred percent with Anthony. I also think that there's going to be advancement in the platforms and the technology, both in terms of the data overlays, think of like a Google idea or an operating system, like a Microsoft where the platforms, the technologies are able to speak and we're using common language and this is going to accelerate. It's also going to take away some of the burden on some of the smaller suppliers, because they don't need a separate piece of software for every customer that comes to them. But it's also going to accelerate a lot of the learnings that we see and some of the standardization, which is what we need.
The challenge in Ag is that nature is not a standardized environment. So, doing something in a field in one part of the country, doesn't automatically, you can't sell that carbon or that practice somewhere else in the country because it's not identical. You've got temperature, water, fertilizer, implements, everything else. But I think all those things are going to advance. I think it'll still be messy in two years though, I don't think we'll be all the way there, but I do think it will be further along and there'll be more players at the table.
Vonnie Estes:Yeah, I think when you look more at like five years and you think about if it's standard, if there's policy and if there's standardization, then that's going to make it a lot easier for people to participate, I think.
Anthony Kingsle:Yeah, I think so too. And I'd also add how important the evolution of technology will be here. Dave, as you pointed out earlier now, testing soil organic carbon, soil organic matter, bulk density of soils in those fields that's not cheap. And it's not easy to do. You have to go into those fields and pull multiple sub samples. And so I'll also be very interested in how technology continues to evolve and, and makes that easier and more cost-effective.
Vonnie Estes:Yeah, because a lot of that work is being done with models now. And Dave, as you said that it doesn't take into account or it can't take into account all the variability. Also, I was talking to someone that they were talking about a technology where a drone could fly over the top and using a sensor could better predict what was going on under the soil. So I think you're right. I think there's going to be technologies where just going out and taking those core samples it's just too cumbersome and we can't build the industry on that, but I think there's an open door for, and a lot of money to fund companies that have different ideas. So in this series of the podcast, we've been talking about how to rebuild a resilient and secure and transparent supply chain. Can you both speak about how fresh food companies are using technology to realize ESG commitments on farm processing and onto the plate? Dave, let's start with you.
Dave Stangis:Yeah, thanks Vonnie. It really is a nice transition from the question you just asked. You're talking about drones, perhaps hyperspectral technology or robotics, a lot of imaging going on. I think that technology is really the unlock and where consumers understand technology it's a win-win, bonus all the way through. There's some technology coming to market that consumers need to be educated on a little bit. So they're bought in and they're brought along, but we're seeing this as we've talked about on farm, this conversation's been basically kind of what we're seeing at the farm level, and it hasn't been the hardware piece, which is a ton of that. Also, just in how food is grown. We had relationships and conversations with vertical agriculture, indoor agriculture, agriculture in a box, specifically design agriculture for certain ingredients that we wanted to, and then replicate that anywhere in the world. Inside the processing or conversion, for example, there's plenty going on, especially around traceability and transparency, making sure that we know where everything's coming from.
If there's claims being made about a lack of a certain ingredient or component or free from this is all enabled by technology. And on the plate, I think is really where the payoffs is. Anthony and I'll let him talk about some of the nutrition, we've seen it play out before there's things in their pipeline and things, and other companies' product pipeline that are really interesting and value added both to the planet, but also to the customer, the consumer, but backing that all up and helping the consumer make informed decisions that they trust and that they feel good about for their family or for themselves is where the value is for everybody. And we had a couple of examples where we were able to tie just some of that storytelling from the plate to the farmer and the farmers feel better.
You know, the mills feel better, everybody on the chain feels better because they're part of the story. And I think that's another opportunity that technology is going to enable.
Anthony Kingsle:Yeah, I very much agree Dave. At Benson Hill we're very focused, engaging those different levels of the supply chain. Those different stages. And connecting our farmers and our growers with consumer trends and really understanding what it is that's driving consumers. And what I think is interesting here, you mentioned around transparency and traceability, those are key words that are really going to help drive this connection, bringing that value chain just a little bit closer together. And technology is going to play a fundamental part. How can we bring that story, that information, that data of that food along with the physical product as it gets to the consumer? I think telling that story really enhances and certainly improves the trust that consumers have within the food industry. So yeah, I very much agree. I think technology is going to be a fundamental component here in order for us to really share that story.
Vonnie Estes:So sticking with you, Anthony, on Benson Hill's website, there is a strong statement from well-meaning to well measured. Tell us more about this work and how you are going about ESG from a measurement perspective.
Anthony Kingsle:As we touched on earlier, there are a lot of companies that are doubling down on their sustainability commitments during COVID and we really saw this in 2020 during the pandemic, we really saw this enhance. We saw a lot of organizations were really focused on this. And at Benson Hill we're not any different, we're really focused on a commitment to the environment, the social responsibility, it's the core of our ethos. And we recognize that these strategies and objectives are really just the first step. So when we talk about this well measured component, we know that there is a thirst for more quantitative information and data from investors, from consumers, from all sorts of different stakeholders. And so at Benson Hill, we're very actively working to identify and measure these quantifiable goals for our behavior as a company and the performance of our products and the impact that we might contribute, whether it's on the farm, through manufacturing or processing or even at the consumer level.
Now we've partnered with an organization called CropTrak where we are aggregating information and data so that we have deep insights into each of those stages of the value chain. And for example, because we're connected with each of those stages, we're able to influence and pull that information instead of going through multiple tiers of suppliers and vendors, we're directly connected. So we have a higher confidence in the information that we're receiving, and we can then feed those insights back into our CropOS system and using tools like a lifecycle assessment, for example, we've identified that during the processing stage for our ultra high protein soybeans, we can actually skip certain concentration steps to reach a high level of protein. And in skipping those steps to create soy protein concentrate, we're able to then remove carbon. And through that lifecycle assessment, we're able to reduce carbon and reduce water use at those stages as well.
Vonnie Estes:Dave, do you have anything to add about measurement and importance?
Dave Stangis:I think just to add a layer above what Anthony said, but I think that ESG space is noisy right now in a good way for some companies. Companies like Anthony's that are focused on this and are building their story early days, there's opportunity to frankly, create a differentiated story with the frankly differentiated results that support your brands and support your mission that supports your marketplace, your financial bottom line. There's noise to manage, especially if you're a publicly traded company. But I do think there's great opportunity in this space. And technology is an enabler.
ESG is very broad, which sometimes it can cover everything and feel like companies have to boil the ocean, but it's a great opportunity for companies to pick the most material things for them, and then build the data systems to back it up because that's really where you get the credibility and the eventual authority on the topic.
Anthony Kingsle:And I think it's combined with what we mentioned earlier on carbon markets, the more information, the more validation or verification you can provide, the higher level of confidence, the industry and potential customers will have when looking at the carbon market and purchasing carbon offsets.
Vonnie Estes:So my last question, both of you have been focused on sustainability and ESG throughout your careers. What are you most excited about for the industry, the food industry, Dave, let's start with you.
Dave Stangis:I'm really, and I don't want to take the story away from Anthony, but I really am excited about technology. I think that technology is something that needs to be embraced. It needs to be put to work. It needs to be communicated in a way where consumers are brought along on the topic and not sold on the topic. And some technology is super easy to understand, and they're 100% onboard and they're frankly taking part. And some of the technology that's coming to play in the food sector is super interesting, but it's also different for consumers. And we need to be able to have a conversation with them, help them understand the value to the environment, the value to the food and to kind of welcome their conversation in the topic.
But I know when I joined Campbell, I came from Intel and I said, we're going to be a technology company. And they're like, no, we're a food company. I'm like, no, every company is a technology company, trust me. No, we're just going to focus on the food. It didn't take long before everything happened. And it wasn't just hardware and software. It was chemistry and biology and transparency and packaging. So I think that the food sector is in a complete positive disruption from technology. And that's what excites me the most. I think it's also what excites the new talent coming into the sector.
Anthony Kingsle:Yeah, completely. And, I've always been in love with the food industry. From when I was much younger and it's because it impacts our lives in such a positive way. It influences our health, our personal health, it brings our community together. Families come together around the dinner table. So I think what really excites me is our capacity to continue to leverage technology and really touch the lives of everyone around the world and help improve the health, nutrition and the sustainability of the food system. And what I think is really interesting, and we have the stat, I think, on our website that talks about how the US spends $1.7 trillion on food annually and spends equally even a little bit more on diet related illnesses. And so our ability to invest in this and invest enough in nutrition, to invest in nutrition and health and the sustainability of our foods, it really has the ability to have such a significant impact. And to Dave's point, technology is going to play a critical role in helping us achieve that.
Vonnie Estes:This episode was fascinating to talk to experts about carbon through the lens of ESG and how technology is, as Dave said, the unlock. As Anthony stated, we can leverage technology and touch the lives of everyone to help improve the health, nutrition, and sustainability for the food system. Well, that about nails it, thank you for listening.

Vonnie Estes, PMA:Welcome to PMA Takes on Tech. The podcast that explores the problems, solutions, people, and ideas that are shaping the future of the produce industry. I'm your host, Vonnie Estes vice president of technology for the Produce Marketing Association. And I've spent years in the AgTech sector. So I can attest, it's hard to navigate this ever-changing world in developing and adopting new solutions to industry problems. Thanks for joining us and for allowing us to serve as your guide to the new world of produce and technology. My goal of the podcast is to outline a problem in the produce industry and then discuss several possible solutions that can be deployed today.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:This episode of PMA Takes on Tech is sponsored by CropTrak. CropTrak enables food and beverage companies to improve their supply chain management from contracts to settlements, one trusted source of secure data at your fingertips. To track what matters go to croptrack.com/PMA. Hello, today, we're going to talk about cybersecurity and agriculture. Cybersecurity is a very important topic to our industry and to the food supply system. I have three speakers with slightly different takes on the problem and solutions. First we will hear from Andrew Rose. Who's an expert in the topic and is starting a Cyberag organization. Andrew gives us some broad information on what is happening now around cybersecurity. Then we will hear a deeper dive for action from Brian Dykstra, CEO of Atlantic Data Forensics. Followed by Bill Danker, a principal industry consultant from SAS with a view on Ag. This is one of those new to me topics that seems to be what everyone is talking about now.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:But of course it has been around for a long time and we have been warned to take precautions. What is bringing it to the forefront in the food supply chain right now is that the Ag industry is particularly vulnerable because we haven't been paying as much attention. The Ag industry has recently adopted a lot of new technology into our operations without the necessary security protocols. Every company is now a technology company, and we need to protect ourselves as such. Let's jump into the conversation with Andrew, where he's talking about the advantages of starting the Cyberag organization in the Maryland area.
Andrew Rose, Cyberag:If you think about cybersecurity nationally, we've got all of the big agencies in D.C., the NSA, the CIA, and a bunch of others who you probably have never heard about. And as employees work in those agencies, oftentimes will spin out and start government contracting organizations and then organizations that serve the private industry. So we've got a real good, critical mass of these types of companies, individuals, thought leaders, and what have you. So it was almost a blessing to be able to stand this organization up in that area. And I've always stayed involved the cybersecurity. I've spent the last six years in agricultural finance, and it was funny. One of the first things I did when I came to the bank was I put on a tabletop exercise, simulating an insider attack on our systems from a cybersecurity angle.
Andrew Rose, Cyberag:I just recognize that there wasn't a whole lot of awareness in the bank. We felt that our defenses were good that we weren't necessarily a target. And what have you. And it was a very instructive event. I won't go into too many of the findings of it, but one of the outcomes was it helps us develop muscle memory. So if something like this does happen in the future, at least we're not relying upon documents that may have been created by somebody else that we pull off the shelf and flip the page three and say, ""How do we contact folks?"" We actually put these things into play into motion. Fast forward to late 2019. And I was invited to attend a private briefing from one of the head intelligence people on some of the threats that China posed for intellectual property theft to a multitude of industries.
Andrew Rose, Cyberag:And after that briefing, I spoke to the authority there. And I said, ""I'm in the agricultural sector, is this something we should be paying attention to?"" And his face went ashen and he said, ""Oh my gosh."" He goes, ""The agricultural sector itself is so at risk right now, we need to get the message out there."" And almost simultaneously, I was recognizing at least in the State of Maryland, that agriculture wasn't getting the attention from the economic development people. That cybersecurity was.
Andrew Rose, Cyberag:In a nutshell, if you put the word cyber in the title of your company, people throw money at you, and they don't really understand what you do. You have agriculture farming in your title, and they tend to relegate you to the children's table. And so I approached a good friend of mine, Mike Thielke, who runs an Ag incubator called F3 Tech and said, ""Mike, we're going to put on a symposium about cybersecurity in agriculture."" He said, ""Andrew, what does that mean?"" And I said, ""Mike, I don't know what it means, but we're going to do it anyway. And we're going to find out what comes of this.""
Andrew Rose, Cyberag:So I invited the intelligence community to come in and speak. And I reached out to the USDA and the USDA brought their chief information security officer out, and we did a full symposium, and it opened a lot of eyes. It really got the ball rolling and dumb luck-
Vonnie Estes, PMA:And this is before there had been attacks in Ag, right?
Andrew Rose, Cyberag:Vonnie, you're reading my mind. I'm so dumb luck. We put the symposium on one week before the SolarWinds breach hit the news.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:Oh, gosh.
Andrew Rose, Cyberag:We are very smart. We probably looked a lot smarter than we actually are, but timing being everything was fortuitous. There was a lot of attention given to us. We recognized immediately. We had to do a follow-up symposium. Some of our friends, I'm in the Delmarva area and we've got billions of dollars in poultry and broilers. And one of the large integrators is Perdue Farms. And they were seeings many or some of their contract growers being hit by threat actors in the cyber sector. And it was having a significant impact on those producers' businesses. So we approached the FBI and we did... And it says, this is widely available and I'm sure we can share links later, a video that describes some of the top attacks that are hitting growers right now, and the FBI then saying, ""Here's the mitigation, after the airbags had gone off, here's what you do. And here's why this matters. And here's how we will then perform.""
Andrew Rose, Cyberag:And Vonnie, again, you hit the nail on the head. It seems that this is really an escalating area of concern in the agricultural community. So as of August 1st, I've decided to leave Farm Credit and full-time run the Cybersecurity Agriculture National Center, and we're standing this up right now. It was an initiative. And now it's a thing, and I'm very excited about this. And so the timeliness of this conversation is just fantastic. And I'm sure your listeners are going to be eager to hear what we have to share today.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:Yeah, I think when I contacted you through Seana Day, a mutual friend of ours and things were just going crazy for you that suddenly you're the expert, and everyone wants to know about this, and you're just starting to stand up this new organization. So it is a topic that's suddenly everybody wants to know about. So if you can walk us through why is agriculture a target for threat actors? Like why is Ag important?
Andrew Rose, Cyberag:As important as we know agriculture is when you look at the entire landscape across the country, agriculture typically falls to the bottom of a lot of lists. It is considered part of the critical infrastructure, one of 16 critical infrastructure categories, but we tend not to get any attention both from the cybersecurity experts, as well as the threat actors and those days have ended. I think that there is a sense of complacency sometime the cultural sector, because we haven't been hit as hard or as frequently, but now with the sophistication of the threat actors, they're looking for any target out there. And there's a dawning realization amongst our adversaries or those that have a financial interest in attacking us that there's a lot of leverage in food.
Andrew Rose, Cyberag:You take food out of the equation and people get very hungry, very fast, and it tends to healthcare is another one. I mean, you're seeing it in the hospitals. If you take a hospital offline, they're more apt to pay whatever ransom to is to get back online quickly. Very similar concept with food and take that off the table, so to speak. But going back to your question, agriculture presents a lot of soft targets for the threat actors. Defenses are fairly porous at times. And if you look at the backend technology that a lot of the producers through agribusinesses are using, they're not always state-of-the-art, they'd never had to be. But this is a new day has dawned upon us in this aspect.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:So what are the current threats and what do you think the future threats are?
Andrew Rose, Cyberag:That's another good question. This is an important one as well. The current threat as of the latest data breach research that I've seen are financial in nature. There is so much money to be made by these criminal gangs out there holding people's information ransom, holding their supply chains ransom. People are paying that money. And I think we need to back up a little bit, talk about ransomware itself. Everyone's probably heard of ransomware, but if you think about it philosophically, if you put yourself in the shoes of a bad guy, and let's say, you're just starting out, let's say you get into a company and steal that information. The amount of money you will get for that information on the black market degrades from the amount of time that you have it.
Andrew Rose, Cyberag:So somebody recognize that their credit card has been stolen. They'll stop that credit card. Their personal identification information just stolen they'll put credit watches and things like that. So you need to sell it quickly. Now, if you're a buyer of this black market information, you want it to be fresh, but you also want to buy it from someone you trust, which sounds bizarre. So the large ransomware gangs are the ones that people trust to buy this information from. So the smaller ones typically will sell that information upstream to the larger resellers, and they take a cut of that. They also will sometimes get into a system. And typically they're in your system for four months, is the average amount of times they move around laterally. They find out when the most vulnerable time to execute the lockdown to encryption of your data is, and they sell all those keys upstream to large gangs.
Andrew Rose, Cyberag:And another thing to keep in mind for your listeners is when a ransomware team gets into your system, one of the first things they do is they try to disable your backups because they don't want you to have any kind of mechanism to recover that data or take them out of that financial equation. Another one that we're seeing, it's not quite as prevalent as their ransomware on the financial side are competitors, and a competitor could be another business. There could be some sort of trade secret that another business would benefit from knowing about from what you have. It could be another nation state, China doesn't play by the same rules we do. They're a country, they have their own ethos and how they operate. And if we're willing to have all of our information out there for the taking, they're just going to take it, why would they spend all that money doing research if they can just get that right now, out there from one of our competitors. And we can go in some case studies and a few minutes about that?
Andrew Rose, Cyberag:And the other one that that gets headlines. And I haven't really done the percentage of these are the hacktivists. Those are the people that might not appreciate animal, livestock raising or processing and insider threats. There could be some folks out there that for whatever reason are dissatisfied with their employer, and they're willing to either through malice or for financial gain turn some of that information over, but far and away the greatest one is ransomware. That's the easy one, the easy target right now. Now you mentioned the future. We talk about the financial gain of some of these threat actors.
Andrew Rose, Cyberag:In my humble opinion, the future are going to be adversarial nation states. It's going to be very apparent that if they want to slow us down or cripple us in some way, going after our food supply is target that I would imagine would be fairly high on their list. And it doesn't always have to be an adversarial nation state, either. It could be a friendly nation state. There were other countries that could benefit from a dip in our agriculture production in a given year that would then increase the amount of money they would make off of their exports or agriculture production. And one area that the FBI is really concerned about is something called deepfakes. And you may have heard about people whose images and voices are now being manipulated through computers, and it's becoming more and more difficult to distinguish those voices or images from a real person.
Andrew Rose, Cyberag:This is an emerging threat and will only become more and more sophisticated as we go on. So it could be that you get a phone call from the CEO saying, ""Hey, we've decided to change our relationships. Please change the wire information to here and send all reminders to this bank account instead."" And you will converse with this person. They will sound and use the same idioms that your CEO may use. And you don't think twice about that. Or it could be you and we can get into this later, you have an internal mechanism where no bank information can be changed or shared without the CEO's verbal approval. And you call the CEO up. And that CEO says, ""Yes, thank you for calling me. And yes, execute that bank transfer the way I've told you to do."" And it was a deepfake all along.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:Oh, my gosh.
Andrew Rose, Cyberag:So this it's future, but it's near shore future.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:Yeah. So how are these threat actors getting into agriculture businesses? You mentioned they can go in and sit for four months. How do they even get in?
Andrew Rose, Cyberag:Right now, as of the 2021 reports that I've read, the number one way is social engineering. So they identify people who might be in charge of finance or your CFO, and they have a long-term campaigns to build a dialogue with these people. And the stuff I'm seeing now is mostly the threat actors are mostly human, but when we start talking about the use of artificial intelligence, they can do a lot more data mining. So I would imagine that if we're not seeing it today, we'll probably see it tomorrow that are human beings utilizing artificial intelligence to gather more data. So they know what kind of sports you like and what kind of food you like. They can build that dialogue and create a friendship with you and rapport. And then I imagine in the not too distant future, those will be completely AI.
Andrew Rose, Cyberag:You might think you're having a conversation with a human or interacts with the human, and it's really a bot out there that's been trained to emulate another human being and all that to get inside of your system. And again, I don't want to disparage the Ag system, but we have a lot of unlocked doors. There are a lot of methods for folks to come in. We talk a lot about the information, or I'm sorry, the internet of things. So all your sensors, all your cameras, all those other little nodes that someone can creep in, get into your system and then start moving around laterally.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:So all these sensors that we're so excited about that are everywhere in the fields and giving all this information back and forth, those can be kind of portals of entry?
Andrew Rose, Cyberag:They really can be portals of entry, but also portals to exfiltrate certain amounts of data. So right now, data is one of the new currencies in agriculture. And if so, if you're leaking that data to somebody and they're listing or gathering that data, now the value to you for that data decreases, and they have access to that. And going back to financial incentives, if you're a threat actor and you want to get somewhere, the easiest thing to do is open the checkbook. I mean, ask 100 people and one will say, yes, maybe they have financial issues, they're medical related or gambling related, or they're just greedy. It's very easy to buy somebody off. And our adversaries recognize that. One of the associations that I follow quite closely is the Animal Ag Alliance. And they've done a really good job of understanding or identifying the hacktivists and the insider threats and how to mitigate those types of things. So I don't know if your listeners are familiar with that association, but I believe some of their videos or documents are available online for general viewing as well.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:That's sounds good. We'll have to put that in the notes. What are some other ways that producers and Agribusinesses, how can they protect themselves from this?
Andrew Rose, Cyberag:Well, I think it all starts with identifying what are your crown jewels? What does that thing that is most essential to your business that would cripple you if that thing was lost or locked away or given to a competitor? Once you've identified that then make concentric rings of security around that. A lot of the stuff is pretty basic blocking and tackling. When that little window pops up to upgrade your Microsoft, click it say yes, always upgrade and patch.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:Oh, all those updates putting off those?
Andrew Rose, Cyberag:Oh, men. And they're annoying. I know they're annoying because sometimes they come unexpectedly and your computer goes blue for 20 minutes. When in the middle of an email, they're crucial. And the reason they come in that way is Microsoft, or whoever it is, is identified a threat that somebody is utilizing right now. And they want to protect all the users. Please don't put those off. An example is the Baltimore City school system, I'm from the Baltimore region, put those off because they didn't want to be inconvenienced because they had to send emails out and the entire system got hacked and then locked out by ransomware. It's these things. It sounds very basic, but it's true. Another one is when you do your backups, when you take all that data and whether you do it weekly or biweekly or daily, take it and remove it from the computer and they call that an air gap.
Andrew Rose, Cyberag:So that makes it a little bit harder for those threat actors to come in there and to travel to that backup in that way. It's a little bit easier to put that in there. We talked about the information of, or I'm sorry, the internet of things. Put some passwords on these devices. A lot of times they come with a factory basic password and people don't think to change that or updated at times, that's always a good idea. There's a term called multi-factor authentication, and you may have seen this where you log into a website and they text you a code. So is two steps in order for you to access that. If you have an opportunity to turn that on, that's an important one and...
Vonnie Estes, PMA:Those are so annoying though, but you're telling me those are important that we should-
Andrew Rose, Cyberag:And going forward, they're going to be ubiquitous. We have to, gone are the days when you have a four digit password and think your Hotmail countless was protected.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:The same password you've used everywhere.
Andrew Rose, Cyberag:Yeah. It is. I know. And well-
Vonnie Estes, PMA:Your birthday.
Andrew Rose, Cyberag:Correct. And that kind of goes to the next one. Is employee training on cyber awareness. There are a lot of organizations out there that provide basic training. Here's what a suspicious spoofing email will look like. Here's when you want to pause before you click on that link and do that thing, and then maybe send out some rudimentary testing. You put the employees through this, well, let's just send out a fake phishing email and see who clicks on it because that's the person that you probably want to have to go through additional exercises. I love tabletop exercises. I know it takes a lot of staff time to do these. It's a four to six to eight hour session, but you have everyone sit around the table and go through the what if scenarios. Let's just say that everyone comes to work in the morning and all of our computers go black, or what do we do now?
Andrew Rose, Cyberag:And then kind of walk through these exercises and you start identifying different gaps that you might have there in your crisis plans. I won't go too deep in that because you always discover things and you probably don't want to share those publicly where the holes are. And then last there is cybersecurity insurance and a lot of people think, ""Well, I pay the premium so I don't to worry about that."" What they don't recognize is cybersecurity insurance. They're becoming more and more reluctant to pay out if you don't have good internal controls, if you're not following these things that you should conversantly, if you do follow these things and you have best practices, and you can demonstrate that sometimes there's a reduction on premium or you get more coverage for your dollars. Hygiene matters a whole lot.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:Yeah. And I think on the insurance piece, from what I've heard too, is that they may help you financially, but you may have had a huge reputation hit that you can't recover from. If they've gone into your customers and attacked your customers, you've lost in trust there. So insurance doing hygiene upfront is better than insurance, but insurance can help. So what can a producer or a business do if they are attacked? We've heard even in our industry and the produce industry, there've been a couple of ransom attacks where the companies paid the ransom because for all the reasons we know it's just cheaper to go ahead and pay it and move on. But is that the best thing to do? What should people do if they're attached?
Andrew Rose, Cyberag:That's a great question. I know that we have somewhat of an international audience for this podcast from the United States, there's a website called ic3.gov. They should go there immediately log what has happened. And that website is a portal for all of the law enforcement intelligence community. So that triggers a response number one, but it also logs trend analysis. The law enforcement would love to be able to get ahead of these so that they start seeing a certain sector or a certain methodology being used to go after these companies. They can start getting ahead of that and either pretty warnings out there or starting to anticipate what the next move is.
Andrew Rose, Cyberag:I'm a huge proponent of bringing the FBI in as soon as possible. And I know something that makes some people nervous when you call the FBI, the FBI is very clear. They are there to impose risk and consequence on the bad guys. They want to make it, they're not there to blame you for doing something that you shouldn't have done clicking on a link or letting somebody in, they're there to find the bad guys and impose consequence upon them. The FBI will also tell you ""Don't pay the ransom."" And this is one of those push and pull things. Some companies, this is a cost of doing business. If you're colonial pipeline and now there is no more gasoline in the Northeast United States. Yeah. You're probably going to pay that bitcoin ransom and see what happens.
Andrew Rose, Cyberag:Now, here's where the supposition comes in. I don't know necessarily who took dark side, that ransomware gang offline, I don't know who sees their servers are clawed back some of that bitcoin payment nor do I think the FBI would ever admit to being part of that, but that's the consequence and the risk is now the next threat actors and say, ""Ooh, maybe I shouldn't go after the gas pipelines,"" which their new inception has put that as a public statement. The bad guys said, ""We won't go after the critical infrastructure, we won't do this."" It's a cat and mouse game.
Andrew Rose, Cyberag:And then you talked about the ransom payments. That's ultimately it's a business decision to be made. Again, the law enforcement community would rather you not do that. It makes their job more difficult. And also they'll let you know that if you pay that ransom now, you're out there on the dark web bulletin boards as somebody who's stroked a check to get your data back. So now you're more likely to be attacked. But I can see it from a business standpoint too, I'll pay the million dollars, just so my $20 million or a hundred million dollar business can get back online as quickly as possible.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:Next we will hear from Brian Dykstra, from Atlantic Data Forensics. Brian has been at this for a while. He talks about the easy things we can do to protect ourselves. Here's Brian,
Andrew Rose, Cyberag:Sure, so I'm Brian Dykstra, I'm CEO of Atlantic Data Forensics, where they call it DFIR providers. So we're a Digital Forensics & Incident Response company, which means that we're the folks that you call when you got ransomware or you had some fraud or business email compromise, or we just handle people's worst days really. And we do it over and over. We do hundreds of incidents every year, thousands over the past 15 years. Got started doing this... Well, I grew up as a farm kid in Oregon joining the military got a FFA chapter president.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:That's impressive.
Brian Dykstra, Atlantic Data Forensics, Inc.:Got into military intelligence with the army worked humid and technical intelligence. And of course, when you leave the military, what you do is you go to a defense contractor. It's an easy transition back into the world. Ended up teaching cyber crime at the FBI Academy at Quantico for a few years to the super cops. And that just continued on that career from there. 2003, Kevin Mandy, and I started a little company called Mandy and it turned out okay, it's a multi-billion behemoth now. So this is what I do, now all day every day.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:So do you work in the food supply chain? Is this an area that you've had some involvement in?
Brian Dykstra, Atlantic Data Forensics, Inc.:We do, we work both in the food supply side as well as in the grower side, the equipment providers side, because nobody right now is invulnerable from ransomware or these business email compromise attacks that lead to further ACH fraud as is, I mean the threat actors are doing this. They don't really care what your business is. They care less about what you do for a living they're about your bank account. And then since so every business has one, the threats now spread across every industry. So where in the past, we might've been sectored around regulated data industries, healthcare, or finance, or things like this. Now we're dealing with everybody because it they don't discriminate anymore.
Brian Dykstra, Atlantic Data Forensics, Inc.:It just doesn't matter. And we've seen that in the press recently. It's all different companies and all different industries getting hit. So is that, but for AgTech, and Ag is the larger Ag communities and stuff like this, extra vulnerable just because there hasn't been a lot of attention really paid to this over the last 10 to 15 years. I mean, there's been some discussions here and there and the USDA has got a nice little website in a report of that maybe, but they're not really, there's not a lot of emphasis in the larger agriculture and food community into that sort of thing. And so unfortunately, we're sitting on a lot of tech debt, we've started to bring these technologies into everything we and into the manufacturing process, and packaging and shipping and transportation, you name it without a lot of security oversight into what's been added on there and what happens if something goes wrong.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:So are there specific things that the food supply chain should be concerned about that are specific to food and Ag?
Brian Dykstra, Atlantic Data Forensics, Inc.:Yeah, so, I mean, everybody's kind of problem number one is ransomware. Because while it's highly preventable, it doesn't take much to keep ransomware threat actors from getting to your company. Most companies just aren't even aware of what they need to do to prevent that. And it's really simple little things. Securing the perimeter of your network properly. Unfortunately most of the ransomware that we handle, they walk right into the door through unsecured services and things like this that the company's had there for years. We just always did it like that. The hackers will find that and they will make you pay for that. There's still this idea that you can use a user ID and password on the internet and that's good enough.
Brian Dykstra, Atlantic Data Forensics, Inc.:That's not good enough anymore. That hasn't been good enough for the last few years. You have to use what they call multi-factor or two-factor authentication which we've all seen. I mean, your bank probably makes you do it now, or PayPal makes you do it, and all these other companies make you do it.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:Its really annoying.
Brian Dykstra, Atlantic Data Forensics, Inc.:It is maybe, but is it really, I mean, how many times a day do you push a button on your phone anyway? I mean, you've got to put four or five, six characters in just a logging into the darn thing. It's not really that big a deal to go. Yeah, that was me logging into the VPN click.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:Yeah, I think that's really true.
Brian Dykstra, Atlantic Data Forensics, Inc.:Is it really annoying or do we just dislike the idea of there's change necessary and the reality is we just don't like change. But that's what gets people into trouble. Because most, again, the ransomware we deal with, the threat actor logs in right through their VPN, because they've stolen a user ID and password there, and then they're inside their network and they go about deploying their ransomware and so on. There's also that prevailing idea out there that's just really old and internet time, which makes it three or four years old. Somehow, John in marketing clicked on a link and that's how we all got ransomware. That hasn't been how we got ransomware in the last three to five years. That's just not real anymore, but unfortunately that's companies tend to put all their emphasis on that sort of idea. So...
Vonnie Estes, PMA:So how do we get it, how does it get in?
Brian Dykstra, Atlantic Data Forensics, Inc.:We get it through stolen user IDs and passwords. And they actually log right into our network through our own remote access, through our Citrix, through VPN. I think it's like that that aren't secured app. And then they just go to town and they deploy it from the inside of the network. And then same thing we don't have, most companies have little to no visibility inside their network as to what's going on from server to server to continue. I'm constantly amazed by how many multi-million dollar companies I work with the don't even have antivirus on their computers in there. It might be on their desktops, but somehow their cloud and server environment, they don't have anything running on them and they can't see what's going on. And so they're just easy picking for a ransomware threat actor.
Brian Dykstra, Atlantic Data Forensics, Inc.:And then unfortunately there's lots of them out there taking advantage of that situation. And realistically, we look at those two factor authentication, control the bad stuff on the edge of your network and put two-factor on things or AV on things. That's not a hard thing to do. I mean, those are all pretty low bar things. And maybe the last thing is just when that pop-up pops up and it says, ""Would you like to patch?"" Say, yes.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:Yeah.
Brian Dykstra, Atlantic Data Forensics, Inc.:Say, yes, Google puts a little thing in the corner and says, restart the update, say, yes. It's free. But we find all the time folks running just the pool, horribly outdated software. And that's the other way that they easily take advantage of us. And the threat actors that are out there right now, it's not super severe, I don't know. Not to say that there aren't nation, state, threat actors out there that are pretty sophisticated. Yeah. They are. They definitely are seen as some exploits by those that are unbelievably complicated, but your average ransomware threat actor, that's going to cause most of us problems they're not sophisticated. They're taking advantage of the really, really simple stuff, which is like you just said, the things I just listed, just the really easy stuff. They're not doing anything complex. They're not particularly skilled. They don't have to be.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:Yeah, exactly.
Brian Dykstra, Atlantic Data Forensics, Inc.:To get into most places.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:So do you work with companies to help prevent attacks or are you mostly response attacks?
Brian Dykstra, Atlantic Data Forensics, Inc.:I would love to, I really would. And we do get an opportunity to, if I'd have gone out to a big airlines company next week that really focusing on getting ahead of the threat to their operations. But in general people don't because you've got other business priorities and I get it. I only got what I need. You've got other business priorities that are the things you're worried about. The next two customers, you're onboarding things like this. We'll, get to that IT whatever, somewhere down the road. And that's this mistaken idea that whatever your business is that isn't also a technology company.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:Yeah, that's the point.
Brian Dykstra, Atlantic Data Forensics, Inc.:We don't have any non technology companies anymore. I mean, I'm sure we do, but they're few and far between most of us, we really rely on that technology nowadays just to make anything happen. And so it deserves that level and importance within the company. So some companies are starting to catch onto that idea, but for the most part, that is just not the case. And unfortunately I end up just getting the call at 3:00 in the morning on a Saturday morning, text I mean and...
Vonnie Estes, PMA:So what should people do when they are attacked, they should call you at 3:00 in the morning or what should they be doing?
Brian Dykstra, Atlantic Data Forensics, Inc.:Yeah, that's why we have the 1-800 number for this call us 24/7 real personal answer, the phone and help you out.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:And they should do that quickly, right?
Brian Dykstra, Atlantic Data Forensics, Inc.:Yeah, you want to get ahead of it. As much as possible, what should really be doing, you should be planning ahead of it, knowing that you aren't going to do that. You should have some plan for if we do get in trouble, where do I call? And unfortunately, a lot of times folks just don't know, they've never ever thought about what might happen. And so we see some of the... and clients that called their CPA firm. I don't know why, that was your first call. You're like, ""Why, why, mm-hmm (affirmative) I'm not sure what that was about, but okay."" Or they call their IT company it was probably the ones that got them involved in some of that to begin with. So that's not necessarily a help. And there was just a lot of things going on out there. Other folks call their local police department or try and call the FBI or stuff like this.
Brian Dykstra, Atlantic Data Forensics, Inc.:They're not going to help you. They're more than happy to take the report, but because it feeds the stats engine, but they they don't send teams of people out to help you get it corrected or tell you what to do or anything like that. So, yeah. So in a lot of cases, you're on your own and it takes just a little bit of prep work. I mean, get with your insurance provider talk to them about cybersecurity insurance and maybe I need to add something on, that's getting much more expensive and harder to get nowadays.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:I bet.
Brian Dykstra, Atlantic Data Forensics, Inc.:But again, because of ransomware. But reach out to, or even your existing IT provider, honestly they've probably been coming to you for a while and saying, ""Hey""-
Vonnie Estes, PMA:Now, I want to pay attention to this.
Brian Dykstra, Atlantic Data Forensics, Inc.:""Talk to you about security ideas you probably need one."" No, no, no. Enough of that. They don't need to hear any more of that. But maybe take a listen, go, ""Hey, what do you guys got? What are we missing?"" Things like that to try and get a little bit ahead of it.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:And what about the people that just say, ""Okay, I'm just going to pay because that's cheaper."" Than try to go through all this?
Brian Dykstra, Atlantic Data Forensics, Inc.:Right. I mean, we look at all of this so we negotiate with ransomware threat actors on a regular basis. And we do pay ransoms on behalf of our clients. But it's only at about 15% or less of the cases that we actually do that. So we take a real close business look at what is our business case for paying this? Why do we pay? Now, if you have a company where look, we have no backups and 100% of our systems are encrypted up and we're just stuck. All right, you're going to need to pay. There's not a lot we can do for you, but if we've got partial backups or some backups, or we can get this system, this necessary for business operations back up and running by reinstalling or reestablishing it or things like that.
Brian Dykstra, Atlantic Data Forensics, Inc.:Maybe there's not a great business reason for us to pay for a decryptor and things like this. It varies because if you have data stolen, which is a common part of these ransomware events now, you're still going to have to do all that reporting. So if you had even lost HR data, you got to report to state's attorneys generals. And if you have a regulated data, you're going to have to port the government agencies, you're going to get penalized and all these things. So you're going to do all of that anyway, whether you pay or didn't pay. So that's not really a factor, you're going to do all those things. And if you have customers, you're going to have to do credit monitoring for them. So you're already going to pay all those things.
Brian Dykstra, Atlantic Data Forensics, Inc.:You're going to deal with all those legal fees and that. So if there's probably not a reason to pay to try and get your data back. And that's the other thing is this idea that you're going to get your data back. You're going to get your data back, but they're also going to keep a copy of it and they're going to sell immediately on the dark net. And then that's just what they do. All your big hacking groups do that. So that idea that you're somehow going to magically give you data back or things like this, and not without a copy going out for sale, because they're very much like organized crime, they're there to make a buck. And there's value in your data. It might not be a lot of value, but some value to somebody and somebody will be willing to buy it. That's just more cash in their pocket for no of a little work.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:Okay. Well, I think-
Brian Dykstra, Atlantic Data Forensics, Inc.:I know I have no good news for you.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:Still so helpful. I know. Well, I'll make sure and put a link to your company in the show notes.
Brian Dykstra, Atlantic Data Forensics, Inc.:Appreciate that.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:I think it's just good. Just these conversations just really important for people to hear them and how important and easy some of the mitigation is. So thank you very much. I appreciate your time.
Brian Dykstra, Atlantic Data Forensics, Inc.:Goodbye. Pleasure. Thank you.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:Now we will hear from Bill Danker of SAS, Bill's role is to deliver technology solutions to the Ag industry and include cybersecurity in those solutions to keep us safe. Bill Danker, AgTech, SAS: Hi, everybody. This is Bill Danker. I am a principal industry consultant with SAS statistical and analytics company here based in Cary, North Carolina. And my responsibilities here are really to provide support and help in the delivery of analytical solutions for agricultural companies. And that includes the delivery of agricultural systems to help and make decision support and analyzing yield and improving nutrient content, and also looking at cybersecurity of those solutions and how they could potentially whether they need to do to keep themselves safe. In the application, a lot of these applications.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:So are there specific things that agricultural companies should be concerned about and what are the potential kinds of attacks that you've seen in looking in this area? Bill Danker, AgTech, SAS: Well, there's always the normal they're after your personal information. I call that the baseline. We're all aware of it. Folks use phishing attacks and other types of attacks to try to get your personal information so that they can steal your identity and go with it. From an agricultural perspective. That's always going to be a concern typically for farmers, large farming operations you don't want to get hacked and then have your personal information stolen at the deal with it. I do think in today's world, it's more of the ransomware level. So we've got the recent example of JBS, the beef packing company. The pipeline that got shut down, those are all examples of ransomware attacks. And for those that maybe don't understand what that is, is nefarious groups. They get bots implanted in your systems. Bill Danker, AgTech, SAS: They're able to then put in an encryption layer across all of your data. This goes on for awhile. It doesn't happen overnight. They're in, this thing gets, and then they wait for the opportune time when they can shut down your systems basically everything gets encrypted and you can't read it. And then suddenly you can't operate and they'll wait for the right time, like the end of the month or when the dollars are going to come in. That you're most exposed because what they're after is money. All that matters. They're not after stealing ID, they're just after the money. But the exposure it is for us, at least from an agricultural perspective as they can shut down aspects of our agricultural pipeline. And that's a major concern for us as an industry. In terms of what folks should do about it. You can go to all of the standard, make sure that everybody is password protected and you're doing all of the baseline security protocols in place. Bill Danker, AgTech, SAS: But what I would recommend to a lot of folks is you do a tabletop test of your systems. So if you've got it's typically for a ransomware perspective, plan it out, pretend like you got an attack, take a look at your backups. How often are your backups being run? Can I restore from those backups and be running within a day or two? The ransomware attacks, if they're there long enough, they'll make it into your backups. So even going to that, isn't going to help you. And have you thought through the implications of all that? So I know a little bit long there, Vonnie, but that's where I think the biggest threats are at today.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:And how do they get in, how do they even get a foothold in and start getting inside your programs? Bill Danker, AgTech, SAS: It's malware that sneaks it away in and there'll be getting very, very good at it. We held a forum last week on cybersecurity. This is the one that I didn't even know about. So in today's world, you go into a restaurant and you scan the barcode, but you can get the menu up. And then you can look at the menu for the restaurant, depending upon the security protocols that, that restaurant chain has implemented. It's possible to get malware embedded in that barcode. When you scanned it. It's now on your phone. It's now creeping through your phone, your systems. I don't want to scare everybody with that one, but the potential is out there, any kind of those phishing attacks you get the text messages that says, ""Hey, it looks like Wells Fargo. You need to respond to this."" Any of those layers where you accept it, and then you've got something coming back onto your phone or onto your device. That's how they get in. And you won't know it. It's a bot that then takes off and it starts replicating itself throughout your systems.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:And those should the backups that you do. I mean, are you protected by if you keep your updates up to date or is there any way to protect yourself there? Bill Danker, AgTech, SAS: You definitely want to have the disaster recovery protocols in place. Again, for companies where you're taking the backups, either weekly or monthly, every six months, you've stored some of them away. It depends on how much you're changing things. Again, as you're changing applications that you're running with, that might impact how you might recover it because you might have to go back six months to that backup and then restore and run from that. So what's the implications if you have to do that? You can have backups to go back one, two years, and then that you're going to be fairly safe, the issue. And this is why I recommend the tabletop exercise. Well, what if we had to go back a year and restore everything? What are the implications to the business? Bill Danker, AgTech, SAS: And can I effectively do that and be back up and running? So I'm not having to pay the ransom. And for a lot of companies, they just pay the ransom. There's a lot of ransomware attacks. You and I will never hear about. Because they hit at the right time, the finance guy that looks at the dollars and go, ""We're going to lose this much money. So they're going to cost me this much to pay him. We keep it under the covers. We pay him and we go on.""
Vonnie Estes, PMA:So when you do pay him, do you get your data back? And are you hold-in? Or what happens if you do go ahead and pay the ransom? Bill Danker, AgTech, SAS: They basically release that encryption, that was spread through your systems and all your data becomes readable again. You're basically, you're up and running in a matter of a few minutes.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:But then did they sell your data? I mean, do you see? Bill Danker, AgTech, SAS: They could. That is the other issue. When we talk about this thereafter money. And you hit on the second one that's also very important. Any intellectual capital that you've developed as a company, if they've gotten in chances are they've pulled that off and they could leverage it to get money in other ways. The other one I thought was interesting that I learned about last week was what if you know that you've penetrated a company and you then announce it, that they're going to get shut down via the dark web, whatever. I can now have partners that can short that stock. And then when it actually hits the press, this company is shut down. Their stock takes a dive while they tried to recover from it, pay it off, they make money both ways. They make money on the ransom that they clear it, and they also make money if they're getting really that... I mean, the challenges are many.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:Yes. So what should a company do if you come in in the morning and you try to start your computer up and you've been attacked, what are the different options of what company should do? Bill Danker, AgTech, SAS: In most companies there's usually a help desk where you call somebody right away and say, ""Hey, I've experienced this."" At a previous company, I won't say which one. I got a strange email. It looked like a phishing email. So what I did was pick up the phone and call the security office right away and say, ""Hey, I've got this."" And there was a couple of times where like, ""Oh, bill, can you forward that to me or send me a screenshot of it so we can look at it."" Bill Danker, AgTech, SAS: And then they can shut it down on their end in terms of understanding the IP, where it's emanating from and get it shut down that way. From a SAS perspective, I'll be talking about what we do, we've got algorithms in place that can monitor internally what's going on across a lot of your systems. And we can flag when something out of the ordinary starts to transpire, may not be an attack, it might be an attack, but it raises the awareness of something going on in the data. And you can then highlight your security folks who can take a look at it quickly and understand if they are under attack and respond to it much more quickly.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:Great. Okay. I think that's given people some things to keep them awake at night. So thanks for that. Bill Danker, AgTech, SAS: Always be vigilant. It's always a matter of being vigilant and being aware of the different types of attack. And again, I can't stress enough doing the tabletop exercises. A lot of companies, they've got a disaster recovery plan. They've got a plan in place, run those through, practice them daily. It'll really help you be better prepared.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:Great. All right. Thank you very much. Bill Danker, AgTech, SAS: You're welcome.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:This is been eye-opening for me to learn about both how bad threat actors can be, but also how easy it is to block a good majority of the threats. Hope this was helpful. See you next time.

Vonnie Estes, PMA:Welcome to PMA Takes on Tech. The podcast that explores the problems, solutions, people and ideas that are shaping the future of the produce industry. I'm your host, Vonnie Estes, Vice President of technology for the Produce Marketing Association. And I've spent years in the Ag Tech sector. So I can attest, it's hard to navigate this ever changing world in developing and adopting new solutions to industry problems. Thanks for joining us and for allowing us to serve as your guide to the new world of produce and technology. My goal of the podcast is to outline the problem in the produce industry and then discuss several possible solutions that can be deployed today.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:Special thanks to PMA member CropTrack for their sponsorship of our new series of PMA Takes on Tech. CropTrack's cloud platform helps companies digitize their entire supply chain to enable real time visibility at any point. From planting to production. Go to croptrack.com/pma to track what matters.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:Our podcast today is about technology transforming business operations. We will do a deep dive with Lipman Family Farms and their process of adopting CropTrack's real time supply chain management. There are a number of companies similar to Lipman and supply chain management companies but we really can't understand the value or the challenges unless we dig deep into a real case scenario. There are pearls of wisdom here that can apply to everyone in the supply chain. We talk to Aaron Hutchinson, President and Co-founder of CropTrack.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:From Lipman we talk to Jamie Marin, Production Operations Analyst and Justin Robertson, Chief Administrative Officer about the incorporation of supply chain management into the Lipman operation. There are so many good nuggets in this conversation about technology adoption. I love the conversation about how the two groups continue to iterate and bring value in leveraging the data. Jamie talks about integrating and iterating with the technology to make sure that the tools fit the needs of the growers and the information is of value.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:Let's start with hearing from Aaron Hutchinson.
Aaron Hutchinson, CropTrak:I'm Aaron Hutchinson, Co-founder and President of CropTrack. I grew up in a small Florida agricultural community. I went to collage in Florida. I did my Navy thing and then joined my partners for our first company which was really focused on military 3D GIS and remote sensing, which we sold in 2005. Using some of those dollars we actually self-financed our second company, CropTrack in 2019. We did a lot of barbecue, a lot of beer and a lot of visiting growers to come up with the defining our mission.
Aaron Hutchinson, CropTrak:Our mission here is to harness the power of data to address supply chain problems. Limiting the availability of safe, affordable and sustainable food. I think it's ironic that more than 12 years later we are still working on the same problem. And it's much bigger than anybody ever thought it was ever going to be. And to me our mission, CropTrack sells tools, deploys no-code development environments, to digitize our customers' unique supply chains. It allows them to be really efficient and agile, while making it possible to identify problems and opportunities to continue improvement. And those improvements can be in their crops, in their contracts and their sustainability or even in their relationships.
Aaron Hutchinson, CropTrak:We're doing this in over 60 countries and 8 languages for 70 primarily fresh and high tea crops. And for global 500 kinds of companies and vertically integrated operators. Much like Lipman. We also work forward our mission through leveraging philanthropy. So we also have a goal here of amplifying non-profit organizations with similar goals that we have to help make a larger impact on the food chain. I'm excited to be here today and on this panel we'll talk about the topic.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:Thanks a lot Aaron and thanks for your sponsorship of this series on rebuilding resilient, secure and transparent supply chains. So we also have two special guests. Two people from Lipman Family Farms. Justin, why don't you start and tell us about Lipman, yourself and a little about the relationship with CropTrack?
Justin Roberson, Lipman Family Farms:Yeah, thanks Vonnie. My name is Justin Roberson. I'm the Chief Administrative Officer at Lipman. Part of my role is really to oversee the IT, the tech and the data technology strategy and initiatives for the company. You know Lipman is the nations largest integrated network of local growers, fresh cut processors and distributors. We're a family owned business for over 80 years and are vertically integrated. So from a vertical integration standpoint we have the opportunity to really control of our supply from seed and varietal tool development to farming, to packing and into some value added initiatives in fresh cut processing, repacking and even distribution.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:Great thanks. And Jamie, how about you?
Jamie Marin, Lipman Family Farms:Thanks Vonnie. Thanks for having us on. I actually started off as an intern here at Lipman about 6 years ago. Now I'm a Production Operations Analyst.[crosstalk 00:05:50]
Vonnie Estes, PMA:Lipman's internships really work! How about that?
Jamie Marin, Lipman Family Farms:I guess they do and so my first project was the implementation of CropTrack. As to that I led the implementation when we decided to do a full scale roll out here at Lipman. That's been part of my role, but within the enterprise my focus is really in deepening our understanding of our data operational to generate and try better decision making.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:So just curious. If someone wanted a cool job like yours, what kind of training did you get? How did you end up with that internship and in this job?
Jamie Marin, Lipman Family Farms:Yeah so I was asked to apply to the internship but my background is more in the traditional IS sense. So I worked a lot in sequel databases and analytics but now I'm like an effective intermediary between operations and IT. So kind of grow into it sometimes and learn as you go.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:Yeah. Yeah great. All right. Justin I understand you're implementing this technology into your platforms and have made some interesting changes to your supply chain management processes. Tell us about the challenges you faces and how data has helped mitigate that challenge.
Justin Roberson, Lipman Family Farms:Yeah so I think we, from a macro standpoint, a number of years ago we really began to see kind of the power of data. And that was when the big data buzz word was floating around. A lot of people were talking about it but I think few in our space were really beginning to look at how do we begin to harness that. And so from kind of a big picture standpoint we were asking really 3 questions. One was, how do we get better at forecasting our crops? So how do we get better in knowing how much crop we're going to have and when? The other is how do we gain insight into what, at a farming level was the unknown, right? There's almost this wall you come up against in farming where you kind of get from a lot of this anecdotal data, you just kind of learn through the years the art of farming, right? And getting past that into more of, well we wanted to find was some of the empirical data with farming in getting into that next level granularity and put the science behind it.
Justin Roberson, Lipman Family Farms:And then the third kind of piece from a data standpoint was, we wanted to digitize the farmers notebook. We noticed early on that we have a network of farms across the US and in each farm has localized management and there's a plethora of knowledge and data that sits in that farm manager's notebook and his notepad and his supervisor's notepad and so we kind of asked the question, how do we begin to centralize that and digitize that so at some point we could begin to pull all that data together and really harness it. And so those were kind of some of the questions we were asking early on and that's when we met Aaron. It was gosh, probably about 6 years ago that we, I think I stumbled upon CropTrack just Google searching, trying to find solutions. And really what stood out to us with CropTrack was the ability to take what we were currently doing and built it, customize it into their platform.
Justin Roberson, Lipman Family Farms:Most of the other solutions at the time were very off the shelf. We had to fit our operation into their platform and it was very rigid and didn't give us a whole lot of flexibility. So that's kind of how we began the CropTrack journey. And there's been a lot of different pieces to that along the way. But you're asking me about challenges, I think, with any kind of tech project, when you're trying to launch something I think this big is always a challenge. From the investment in resource standpoint, from the time and energy from key personnel and then to primarily the user adoption right? You're taking a lot of employees that maybe had never even hardly worked with a computer, because they're working more hands on on the farm as supervisors, mechanics, very kind of tractor operators and asking them now to carry an iPad and begin capturing a lot of their information and notes into and iPad. And I think the challenge is really in where we really going to make the investment to make this kind of change and have this kind of impact that we're hoping to see.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:Yeah through the whole chain because that's a lot of different people. So you were actually looking. You said you did a Google search, so you were actually looking for supply chain management. Was there something that happened that you said, oh okay now we need to find someone to help us with this? What happened that made you think you needed help there?
Justin Roberson, Lipman Family Farms:Yeah I think there was a lot of internal discussion you know. Lipman has been farming for generations and decades now, so there was never this feal that we were missing something. I think if anything, we've been one of the kind of best in cost from a farm operation standpoint. But a part of that is that we've always pushed ourselves on, how do we get better. And what are we missing? What's kind of the next step? The next iteration in this process and I think a lot of us came to the conclusion that it was, we needed really seriously to begin looking at, specific to our farm operations right. So the crops or supply chain on the farm operations, we needed to begin looking at a much more efficient way to begin digitizing data and then to begin harnessing it and mining it in a way that was going to be give us more of a competitive advantage.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:Great. And so did you adopt a whole program at once? Or did you start with pieces and try one piece, and then try another piece and try to tie them together? How did that work? Because you said you didn't have to put your whole system into a system that was already set up and in a way that didn't fit you. So how did you kind of start with the whole system?
Justin Roberson, Lipman Family Farms:Yeah that's a great question. We started slow because of that. We knew that if we really wanted to make something like this work it really had to be, it had to make sense to the operator, to the farm manager, the supervisors that are going to be using it. And we wanted it to mirror as much as possible what they were doing. And so to do that on the front end took a lot of work from our end to really customize the crop check platform the way that we really needed it to work with our operations. And so in general then yeah we started small. I think we started with one license probably for a number of months and sure Aaron and his team were really wanting to try and sell a lot more but we were slow adopters and we wanted to make sure it was going to work and we approach a lot of our projects that way and try and phase it.
Justin Roberson, Lipman Family Farms:But build it in a way that if we can prove it out on a small level, that then we could quickly then be able to scale it right? And so I think there was a lot of work put in on the front end that gives us the ability really, once knew this thing was really going to work, begin to scale it across all of our operations, is the way we needed to, that's where Jamie's involvement came into play as an intern and then now it's his professional career. He's helping us really take some of that vision and some of those ideas and help make it then scalable and get all of our operations on board.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:So how long did that take to implement or are you still in the process of implementing?
Justin Roberson, Lipman Family Farms:We're still implementing. [crosstalk 00:14:15]
Aaron Hutchinson, CropTrak:And I would say every customer is forever evolving, because they [crosstalk 00:14:19]. Their processes are getting better or they're changing the way they think about things and so it's not uncommon for some to be 4/5 years into it and still kind of evolving the product.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:That makes sense.
Justin Roberson, Lipman Family Farms:Yeah, you know, the minute we are not implementing is the minute I think we've gotten to comfortable. We've slid down. So we've been using the CropTrack platform now for a number of years and we're still adding to it. We're still building onto it. We're still finding new things that we can incorporate it with. So yeah, absolutely. And I think you said that on the onset, Aaron, just in terms of talking about the company. I mean he is always trying to evolve and iterate and get better and I think in the same token we are doing the same with the product. We're continuously adding features to it for sure.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:So from a management perspective, what are some of the key learnings that would help others in the produce industry and improve the efficiency of their supply chains.
Justin Roberson, Lipman Family Farms:You know change takes time. And I think there's a lot of expectations that, when we launched this we would have it fully implemented. That we would have all the users on board. But that was a process. There was a lot of stakeholders in a process like this and a lot of people involved and so something that we learned quickly was that this wasn't obviously going to be a success unless the user base was involved. And so really being able to build kind of the reputation with the user base and focusing on that I think really helped make this a success. I think just in general, change is always a challenge and it can be a challenge no matter what kind of solution we implement. But I think those things we kind of learned, and I think we still see it and there so much opportunity within our supply chain and within other supply chains to continue just to leverage some technology like this and even other solutions that will give us a lot more visibility into our supply chain. The ability to streamline and implement more efficient and optimized processes.
Aaron Hutchinson, CropTrak:I think he said something really important there. He said he got his customer. His customer involved in the sense, his user, his field user. So many times big organizations adopt IT projects like this and IT rolls it out. And the person in the end gets whatever they deliver and one of the things that limited really well was almost at the beginning there was a user sitting there at the table, having a vote, on what was good and what was bad. Maybe it was bad for IT but it was good for them, and we had to figure out how to bend the data to make it useful on both ends. So I think that's a really important message.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:So Aaron, just-
Justin Roberson, Lipman Family Farms:Absolutely. And I think, yeah go ahead.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:No I was just going to ask Aaron to follow up on that. So how much specialization do you have to do with customers in the ... do you have to change the product that you're delivering to them or can you just help them solve some problems on the current products that you have?
Aaron Hutchinson, CropTrak:So we're a no-code environment and the way we assemble it is really how we bend it to meet their processes and everything. So hopefully, these guys would say yeah, Shani and the team where a part of their team because we had process engineers who were professionally trained to get into the process with these guys and help them out. But we're there in the trenches with them almost all the time to ... helping them push the envelope for the tools and then whenever we've got to bend the tool and the engineering to make it do something they want to do, we go do that too right. We we're involved in all our customers lives. We don't just get in to drop it and run. Which is good and bad right? So we learn a lot about food and a lot about our customers.
Justin Roberson, Lipman Family Farms:CropTrack has been a great strategic partner through this rollout. From monthly to weekly calls, and status and as far as the implementation goes they have been our biggest partner aside from our user base for sure. And Jamie alluded to this in her introduction but it circles back to what Aaron was saying, having somebody like him, he was our go between, between operations and IT kind of helping to mend that relationship is critical and in key. So somebody that can speak the operation language, can understand it, can know exactly what the operators need, but then come back and also be able to speak some of the IT language and be able to help pull together some vision for the IT side of things as well. Like Aaron said, the CropTrack no code environment gave us the ability to kind of build out a lot of what we wanted to with little to no IT expertise. But then internally we've also layered on all kinds of, some of our IT systems and infrastructure to speak with and work with a lot of the CropTrack data. And so having somebody in a role like Jamie's really helps make that a success.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:So Jamie, takes us onto the farm. Can you describe some of the improvements you've made and how growers are responding?
Jamie Marin, Lipman Family Farms:Yeah definitely. Like Justin alluded to earlier, we set out with this immediate goal of digitizing that farmer's notebook which gave us a great template or a great platform for what we wanted to achieve. So right there it gave us everything that they think is important, and everything that they're referencing in order to make the decisions that they're doing. So from there we got a great foundation for a data collection system that previously was very inefficient and scattered across pretty much all parts of the US. We had issues with, we almost came up with a CropTrack dictionary that, at this location they call it this, and at this location they call it this. So being able to effectively put that together was a huge improvement operationally to begin with. So that was one of the very first improvements that we set out to do was, we need to make this universal, for us.
Jamie Marin, Lipman Family Farms:And from there we just copied that farmer's notebook. We built some reports on top of it and now there's a source for data across lots of other departments and divisions. But then we took a really strong and early look at our scouting and our crop monitoring, so that's been digitized on CropTrack now for about 6 years. And with the ability to import or back load some of the information we have weekly crop monitoring information going back about 10 years. Which is invaluable to us and is available to us in any format that we think is useful at that time.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:So how is technology helping you to assess the information and increase transparency across your supply chain?
Jamie Marin, Lipman Family Farms:Yeah so I think data collection systems like CropTrack allow us to be really intentional about what we capture. One of the biggest advantages that we found using CropTrack is the flexibility to measure what we want, and how we want it and still be the owners and regulators of our own data. That ability to customize has really allowed us to place CropTrack right at the pillar of our data strategy and it's one of the first things that we look to when there's a novel problem to solve in terms of data collections. It's like, can we put CropTrack to do that?
Vonnie Estes, PMA:So what did you have to do to engage your customers or your partners in the system? Was there any hesitation or worry, what were the issues that you had to solve and can you give an example of someone you worked with that was maybe in particularly challenging?
Jamie Marin, Lipman Family Farms:Yeah. So I think, from the onset we recognized that we needed, that we had this opportunity to leverage out data. That was the goal that we saw from a data strategy standpoint, well not yet, because I was still an intern, but I came to learn that a little bit later. But we had to first and foremost make the farmers and their supervisory, their foremen, we had to make their lives easier. And we need to make it a farm censored initiative. Like Justin talked about earlier, it really was that a lot of the time I would be weeks and weeks away from the office because I was at the farms working on a problem, integrating, iterating and truly answering to them in order to create that bond between the user and the product so that it mended well and it was used properly. But yeah, I think innovation in general was really iterative. We tried capturing some data in some ways, and that didn't quite work, and it wasn't ... but I think they'll be the most honest when it doesn't' work. And maybe not so honest when it's working just fine.
Jamie Marin, Lipman Family Farms:But when something's not user friendly it's quickly rejected. We can see the usage on some of the forms and we can see that they're not filling them out. But every year we have our farmers retreat where we group up all the farmers from around the country. And this year we did a presentation on how we're supplementing some of their existing reporting with machine learning models that we built using the data that they're collecting in CropTrack. And one of our owners came up to me after the presentation and he said something to the effect of, ""If you would have told me that when we started this initiative you would have had an IT guy talking analytics, machine learning and AI and having those farmers right there and engaged in asking questions, and not throw me out of the room when I told them I can predict their yields better than they could, I would have called you crazy.""
Vonnie Estes, PMA:That's great.
Jamie Marin, Lipman Family Farms:I think it's shows that making the tool about them as opposed to this sort of some corporative thing that they need to abide by, it created great rapport and communication channels between IT and farming. And I think they trust that they're not just the users, but they're key stakeholders and they can steer that ship in whatever way they want.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:That's great. That's a great answer. So Aaron, you work with many growers in produce. Some in the beginning stages of their tech journey, others like Lipman that are way out ahead. What can others learn from your past technology implementation?
Aaron Hutchinson, CropTrak:That is a great question. As you heard Lipman say, I'll kind of rephrase it, if you track it you can approve it, right. But based on who you are, and they also said this, the it. The thing that will likely make a difference in the organization, is it one size fits all? And we told you even within his organization and all of his farms had a little one size fits each organization, sub organization. So that's one of the reasons why we have a tag line on our website that says, track what matters, because in the end that's all that matters is that you get the kind of information you to ML or get to decision making that you're talking about. And one of the, and I explained a good reason why we have a flexible platform. I was going to say, when he was talking about rolling it out and all that, a company really shouldn't abandon what's really working for them because they want to do digital capture of important data. And instead what we need to do is put in place some sort of processes that allow them to capture the essential information and capture the business rules that go along with it.
Aaron Hutchinson, CropTrak:Because it actually takes both of those if you want data confidence and data repeatability. Because if you don't have either of those you're just guessing all the time anyway. And you're not going to get to the kind of end goal that you're looking for. Kind of an example, I think COVID was a great validator of how important having data and embedded business rules in your digital platform can be for an organization. I think COVID required everybody to break their routines, distribute their employees, and find new ways to kind of get business done. And for all our customers, they knew that they didn't need every one of those contracted acres they had out there. But they still had to fulfill some their contract obligations. And so what was interesting was, they took the tools to determine the most profitable areas to harvest By considering their grower contracts, their hauling contracts as executed against them, where their processing facilities were and such and then they were able to tweak those business rules inside the tool and execute those changes. To only pick those individual fields and bring them in and meet those contracts.
Aaron Hutchinson, CropTrak:We needed very little impact on their employees, their growers and ... because we were doing it at business rule level inside the tool, we also still were able to 100% audit all of the loads that came across the scale when we're working towards a settlement. And if you had had to try to do that on the fly with paper and that would have been just almost an impossible, untenable thing that you want to take on. And so I got really excited to seeing this software doing this agile task, because that's the way I think about it. Somebody in the room said, ""If we could just figure out which ones are the cheapest ones, we should only harvest those."" Then it led to all of these no code changes that allowed this to happen and what was kind of cool was to hear the customer's excitement. Where the time that took him to do it, which was really, really fast, and the money he saved making his decisions. And I'm sure Lipman has some examples somewhere that is relevant inside of their infrastructure.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:That's a great story yeah.
Jamie Marin, Lipman Family Farms:I think Aaron just to add onto that, we definitely do. I think we have created additional clear channels of information and communication flowing from the farm through payroll, packing, sales, accounting, they all rely on the data that's being stored in CropTrack to do functional business. That is a core part of what we do in that process. The CropTrack data comes first and we believe and understand it to be correct through the processes that we've set up. And there's always checks and balances in our system and in our enterprise but CropTrack being able to do some of those things has been a huge help for us.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:SO kind of going out in scope a little bit for the group, what do you think are the biggest challenges you anticipate for the produce industry going forward and how will technology solve them? Aaron why don't you start?
Aaron Hutchinson, CropTrak:Well well I would say labor is probably one of the biggest ones for everybody. Particularly in the produce world. And I think we're seeing all kinds of things happen around this, between robotics and vertical farming and I think there's no lack of creativity trying to be applied to this business to solve that business problem there. I think that's probably going be the biggest form because it's labor cost a lot and the number of people that takes to do these things and the number of people that are around we got to feed. These are compounding problems that we have to kind of deal with.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:Yeah. Justin or Jamie do you have anything to add to that?
Justin Roberson, Lipman Family Farms:Yeah I always come back to it's something like 40% of the product that's grown in the field never makes it to the fork. And that's really one of the challenges of the food waste problem. And so I agree with Aaron, absolutely labor is probably one of the biggest challenges for ag. But right there with it is the idea of, how do we get better. And so this idea of some of the food waste I think we see as an opportunity. And really it just means that there is so much more we can get better at across the supply chain. And the only way, or the primary way we're going to get there I believe really is with coming up with innovative tech solutions.
Justin Roberson, Lipman Family Farms:And whether it's robotics, whether it's a lot of AI that's coming out that's going to help optimize supply and demand. There's all kind of things I think from technology on the forefront of it really is going to have an impact on the produce supply industry as a whole. And so we're excited to see that and I really think you're going to see a lot more sufficiencies gained in the whole fresh product supply chain.
Justin Roberson, Lipman Family Farms:And we're starting to see some of it on our end. We just think there's so much more to go and so that gets us excited. We're opportunistic and I think it's reflective of the rest of the industry.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:Mm-hmm (affirmative). So how has technology helped Lipman maintain its resiliency, be that to COVID, climate change or other economic pressures?
Jamie Marin, Lipman Family Farms:Yeah so I think just as the cost of input and the landscape just becomes more and more complexed, having the visibility to our operations through that operational data that we're storing and capturing in tools like CropTrack, it will help us fill in the pieces of the puzzle that we fill in the market place or the labor force, and identify which ones we can control and the ultimate goal is to keep our operations costs low.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:Mm-hmm (affirmative)- With increasing expectations for transparency across the supply chain, on the grocery shelves or label, or from an ESG perspective, where do you think the produce industry will be in 5 years? Get your crystal ball out.
Justin Roberson, Lipman Family Farms:I'll would probably add to your list there, transparency of carbon. If we think about how we started with transparency with food and how it's grown to be just the food itself but the input into the food and all of that, I think we are going to look at carbon in the same way. I think carbon's a crop. And like a crop we're going to have to track it and do all of those bits and pieces. So in 5 years I think you're going to look back a 503 company is going to say, ""Was that a good carbon? Was it collected by a dirty battery or was it collected by agronomic practice that left the world better than we found it kind of thing.""
Vonnie Estes, PMA:So Aaron are you guys thinking about how to track that then, and how to have that be part of what you offer?
Aaron Hutchinson, CropTrak:We already do. And we do it for some really large companies on a global market.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:I didn't know that!
Aaron Hutchinson, CropTrak:So we're tracking, encapsulating, working with universities both in the US and Europe for ESG calculators and as well as sustainability and compliance. Because the other side of this is there's a whole level of compliance that's coming with the EU's version of the Green Deal some other kinds of things that are going on around the planet. So you can't just sell your food anymore. You need to sell with all the paper. And so all of that paper needs to be there at the same time as the arrival. And so for our customers we help them make sure that every piece of that paper is there as well as filled out properly, so their product is received and accepted.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:Kind of leads to my next questions which is, earlier this month the UN issued a report calling on agriculture specifically to reduce the impact of climate change. What immediate and long term changes do you foresee?
Justin Roberson, Lipman Family Farms:I think Aaron hit on that quite a bit. There's going to be more and more regulation requirement to begin to track a lot of this. I think some of the food waste issues that we talked about across the global supply chain is going to continue to be a focus. And then the transparency thing, I think it all has been there from the onset of the food safety requirement and it just continues to evolve and expand. And so the company we've called it excess to the acre, and really only give our customer that access to the acre and so in a lot of ways I think that there's of this that's going to become the new norm and is already with onset of blockchain and other technologies that are giving companies the ability to track some of their supply chain through this. But I think that the flip side is, it's going to reward those that are doing the things. And for those that are great operators, I think they're going to continue to be able to perform and do well. And I think the challenge is going to be maybe for those that have operated somewhat in the dark or under the radar.
Justin Roberson, Lipman Family Farms:It's going to force them to change some of their policies and procedures with the things that they're doing into they perform to stand again and play, I think it's going to reward, like I said, a lot of the good actors will be rewarded to do this and there's going to be a lot of value to that. Some of that transparency and accountability will come with it.
Aaron Hutchinson, CropTrak:I think you hit on something right. I mean the most progressive produce guys were already using sustainability resource saving processes, drip tape and everything else because it meant that they had less costs in their crop which helped them with their profitability and all of that. So this is not a new concept I think for a lot of the produce guys. I think it's a new concept for cows and people with large range areas. At the end of the day we're only talking about 2% of farmland usage in North America or in the Americas is really produce. So our impact as a community is a little bit small from that perspective because we don't a lot of acres to work with. But because water is so expensive in the places where we ... in Arizona and California where we grow these things, we've always been resource retrained and it has benefited those who've taken our sustainable kind of processes right out of the gate.
Aaron Hutchinson, CropTrak:Like you said, I think if those who've been able to get away without being able to do that, because they live somewhere with unlimited water or the like, this is going to be a lot harder for them. I think it's going to be a documentation really issue. The UN's processes, when I look at them on a more global level for some of our customers, we're worried about the Jaborandi rain forest to plant that crop. Are you employing the indigenous population and not paying them, so slave labor, are you employing children under age, are you not paying a reasonable salary, are you not providing education and things like that.
Aaron Hutchinson, CropTrak:So the paper part of agriculture is getting thicker and thicker. And the community wants to know that story on the receiving end of it. That they didn't do harm in the process of feeding themselves. When I think about all these things is, I can't be healthy if the thing I put in my mouth isn't healthy, and the place it was grown wasn't healthy, and the earth that it was grown in wasn't healthy. So there is a tie, this stuff does all tie back together in the end.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:Mm-hmm (affirmative)- So my last question. Not meant to be a trick questions, but I was just curious. What's the favorite product to you all that Lipman grows or produces. And you can use either a crop or a brand. So Jamie let's start with you.
Jamie Marin, Lipman Family Farms:I actually, I really like the Romas. We're getting them more and more close by at our grocery stores here in Florida. So I'm saying I think always the top favorite. I really like to cook and it's the core of a lot of my recipes, is tomatoes or tomato sauce.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:Fabulous.
Justin Roberson, Lipman Family Farms:I'll go with our flagship brand, the Crimson Queen. That's really a B&B food service standpoint so a lot of the people are probably eating the Crimson Queen without necessarily realizing it. But tremendous flavor, color, just probably one of the best fewer growing tomatoes that's on the market.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:I hope you enjoyed this real life look supply chain management. Thanks for listening. That's it for this episode PMA Takes on Tech.

Vonnie Estes, PMA:Welcome to PMA Takes on Tech, the podcast that explores the problems, solutions, people and ideas that are shaping the future of the produce industry. I'm your host, Vonnie Estes, vice president of technology for the Produce Marketing Association. And I've spent years in the Ag tech sector so I can attest, it's hard to navigate this ever changing world in developing and adopting new solutions to industry problems. Thanks for joining us and for allowing us to serve as your guide to the new world of produce and technology. My goal of the podcast is to outline a problem in the produce industry and then discuss several possible solutions that can be deployed today.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:This podcast is sponsored by Behr. At Behr, we believe human ingenuity can shape the future of agriculture. For more than 150 years, we've used science and imagination to advance health and nutrition, and together we can achieve so much more. We've committed to a world where biodiversity thrives in harmony with humankind, where hunger and climate change are terms relegated to history books, where farms are more sustainable with plants that are more adaptive and resilient to help improve life for families and communities. In short, where agriculture is part of the solution.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:As a new leader in agriculture, we have the opportunity and the responsibility to grasp this moment to continue moving humanity forward by tirelessly shaping what's possible. Today's podcast is your opportunity to hear a rebroadcast of a well attended PMA virtual town hall on gene editing. Gene editing has been thrust into the public interest. It's a breeding tool that can help make our food more nutritious, convenient, and grown more sustainably. As we will hear, it also has the potential to save the banana from a devastating disease. One of the things that we learned from the Q&A and conversations around this virtual town hall is the misunderstanding of the difference between GMO and gene editing.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:GMO stands for genetically modified organism and refers to plants created by altering genes with laboratory techniques in ways that conventional forms of breeding and nature can't, often by inserting genetic material from one species to another. There are very few genetically modified foods in produce. These include the innate potato, Arctic Apple, some sweet scorn and squash varieties, the papaya and the new Del Monte pink pineapple. Gene editing is also a molecular tool that can alter genes in an organism's genome, but gene editing is done without inserting any foreign DNA.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:The types of changes gene editing does to the genetic code, like deletions or alteration of genes, occur in nature all the time. With gene editing tools, breeders can make desired changes more precisely and quicker than it would take in nature to get the sought after benefit. We will hear from a panel of executives from three top companies working in the area. Haven Baker is the co-founder and chief business officer at Pairwise. Fayaz Khazi is the CEO from Elo Life Systems and Gilad Gershon is the CEO from Tropic Biosciences. Let's join the conversation as Haven Baker is introducing Pairwise.
Dr. Haven Baker, Pairwise:I represent Pairwise. Our mission is to build a healthier world through better fruits and vegetables, and we're primarily focused on increasing fruits and vegetable consumption. And we're trying to do that through differentiation, so we're using gene editing to create new items that, I mean, consumers haven't seen or solve a consumer problem that prevent people from eating fruits and vegetables. And I can talk a little bit more about that later.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:Thank you. Fayaz, how about you?
Dr. Fayaz Khazi, Elo Life Systems:Sure. Yeah. I'm here representing Elo Life Systems. I serve as the CEO of Elo, and Elo is a North Carolina based food and agriculture company which leverages computational biology and the power of genome editing together to develop products that improve human health and the health of the planet. And what we are trying to do here is two fold. One part is we are trying to show and demonstrate to the world that there is a whole lot to be leveraged by combining multiple technologies, and therefore, enable development, faster development in multiple products, especially in specialty crops.
Gilad Gershon, Tropic Biosciences:Gilad Gershon, I represent Tropic Biosciences. We're based in the UK with a team of just over 100 professionals. Tropic Biosciences we've around since 2016, we focus on using gene editing in a host of tropical crops. And currently our main focus is around three of these which are coffee, bananas and rice, where we focus on the use of the technology in developing different products.
Gilad Gershon, Tropic Biosciences:Some of them intended to improve the quality of the crop, for example, our low caffeine coffee variety, and others more then to increase the resistance to different diseases. For example, different projects in banana against Panama disease or in rice against rice blast. So again, it's a pleasure to be here and happy to participate and address any questions.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:Great, thank you. So I thought we'd start with my first question of just giving people an understanding of how gene editing works. Not necessarily technically, but when you work in a company that develops products using gene editing where do the ideas come from? How do you work with it? What kind of resources does it require? And how do you really get a product to market that's been gene edited? Fayaz, why don't we start with you and you can walk us through.
Dr. Fayaz Khazi, Elo Life Systems:Sure. Our platform gene editing technology is called Arcus Technology, it's a technology that's derived from chlamydomonas. So we call it's nature's own editing system, and so it's a highly versatile platform that can do pretty much what we want it to do with a great deal of efficacy and efficiency. So in a typical process, what we try not to do is we try not to guess that this is what the market needs. So this is where technology and business models come into the picture. So we rely heavily on those who are leaders in the business, who are leaders in the market, to direct us towards what is that trait that the consumer has been looking for, for multiple years?
Dr. Fayaz Khazi, Elo Life Systems:And what we bring to the table is how does one go about developing that trait? For example, our partnership in banana with Dole, the biggest problem in banana is TR4 Fusarium Panama disease, and this is where Dole came to us and they said, ""We need to solve this."" And so the very first thing was for us to identify those genes that contribute to resistance to Fusarium. And then from a genome editing perspective, we would identify approaches which fit into certain regulatory categories, or whatever the consumer has the preference towards, and then start developing or working in that direction. So that's just one example.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:Thank you, Gilad how about you?
Gilad Gershon, Tropic Biosciences:Sure, with pleasure and I'm happy to share my view. I have to say that unlike some of the experts here, my background is not in biology so for me, the last five or six years have been very educational. And I think that there's a difference between how I imagined this process to be five or six years ago, and what we've gone through over that time. With a different thinking about taking a product from the conceptualization phase and into the market, I think there's two main phases. And again, it's a very broad simplification I would say, but usually, when we begin it's very much science oriented.
Gilad Gershon, Tropic Biosciences:We're fortunate to have a lot of really bright researchers and fantastic scientific advisors, we're constantly bouncing around ideas that we test through the market and try to see more. And if we're talking about for example rice, we look at different diseases and all the diseases that we can address, are these quality traits that are interesting? Maybe even on a personal note, I think that a lot of the conversations that we have, we have an open WhatsApp group for the team and every day I see the team keep shooting different research papers that they encounter and there's always the question, is this interesting or is that interesting?
Gilad Gershon, Tropic Biosciences:So I would say that from that initial process, we end up with a few interesting products that we think that we would want to pursue or not. And then we have a good process of testing it against the market and seeing if those really have potential to justify the investment and the time to market. So this is the initial and usually the fun part, so after that there's a very long process of technological development, but I think this is also where there's different components that come into play outside of the technology phase. So very clearly, intellectual property is a massive component in that and we try to include these professionals very early on because that could have a massive impact on the commercial opportunity in the life of the product in the market.
Gilad Gershon, Tropic Biosciences:And business development is massive, the different products require different partnerships and different collaborations, and we try to do that from an early stage. The least fun part I have to say is the regulation, which I'm saying it's the least fun because it's actually incredibly complex at sometimes. And at least in our experience, there's not a lot of people globally that are really big experts in the space, so we try to work with these professionals, again, relatively from an early stage to make sure that we tick all the boxes and we address our development in a mature phase. There's a fun part in the beginning, but the execution of making sure that, again, everything is done properly that can take several years and involve a lot of professionals, many of them true experts in their fields.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:All right. Thank you. Yeah, we'll talk some more about regulation and especially get your input from Europe and the UK, which is different than the U.S. Haven, how about you? Walk us through how Pairwise thinks about products and product development, and what it takes to get to market?
Dr. Haven Baker, Pairwise:You bet. So maybe separate the two things we've heard and a little bit on the idea phase, where the ideas come from, and then maybe I'll go a little bit more in the nuts and bolts about what gene editing is and how you eventually get to see plants or a product if that's okay, briefly. So we've taken a different approach which generally in agriculture, most technology development and in a lot of things is incremental, right? You're trying to solve last year's problems, but you're not trying to take this great leap forward. Again, we're about driving consumption with consumers, and where have we seen fantastic consumption increases?
Dr. Haven Baker, Pairwise:And if you look in the last 30 years, it's things like baby carrots, and blueberries, and actually seedless watermelon, for example. And we've seen both growth rates that have been impressive as well as consumption increases, so that's what we're after. So for example, we're interested in cherries and so the first idea was, if we could just get a mirror around we'd add a whole bunch of consumption. And we hired a consultant and we had them go survey a whole bunch of cherry companies and growers, and only one out of 20 came back and said, ""Please take the pits out."" So that's the great leap forward to not have to spit out the pit, but yet it's not obvious.
Dr. Haven Baker, Pairwise:So then all right we'll say, ""Okay, now that's our idea, can we create a pitless cherry?"" What we would do is we would go look in other all relatives of cherries, peaches, plums, pushes, ornamentals, and say, ""Has nature already produced a seedless or pitless one?"" And it turns out it has, and then the question is okay, ""So could you do that through conventional breeding?"" It turns out you can, but it would take about 150 years. Because you'd bring in this rare variant and you'd cross it with a cherry, and what you get won't be either a cherry or the rare variant and you keep crossing, 150 years later you might have a pitless cherry.
Dr. Haven Baker, Pairwise:And we'll do now is say, ""Okay, can we make that genetic change? It's very small, it's sexually compatible, and can we do that with CRISPR?"" And so we'll take a couple of years to develop this process of getting the CRISPR into the plant, then we'll take a couple of years to make the plant. And then if it magically all works, and sometimes it does and sometimes it doesn't, now we've got one tree with pitless cherry, and now we have to go create root stock and clone it and go to market, and that takes about another five years to get all those orchards going. So where you had 150 years for the regular processes, these new breeding techniques can shorten that to what we're thinking about is 10 years for cherries.
Dr. Haven Baker, Pairwise:And just for in our case, we're about three years in, so we think we'll get there by the end the decade. Some of the other things that we're working on berries and leafy greens are much faster, so hopefully that helps Vonnie.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:Yeah, I think that's a really good way to talk about it, because people say, ""Oh, this is so much faster, it's so fast."" So then a lot of people think that's going to happen really quickly, like within a year you're going to have all these products on the market, but like you said, it's not that fast. It still takes a lot of time, and there's a lot of checks and balances, and there's a lot of testing, and so there is work that goes into it and it takes a while to get these products on the market. So I'm going to continue to work through some list of questions, but I do welcome questions from the audience because one of the things that we want to do around gene editing is make sure that we're bringing everyone that's involved in the whole food supply chain along with us.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:And the understanding of what gene editing is, what the benefits are, what the concerns are, so this is a great platform to be able to ask your question. It's rare that you would have three experts like this that are working in the field, so really ask your questions and I'll try to work through as many of the questions as I can, and we'll get answers to your questions if we're not able to answer them on today's program. So I am going to look at some of these other questions. So what is the biggest bottleneck in getting new traits to market? Where is innovation getting stuck right now?
Dr. Fayaz Khazi, Elo Life Systems:The number one thing in my opinion is the lack of disconnect between real consumer needs and the perceived consumer needs, and I think there needs to be some level of leveling between those things. And there's always that cycle of hype and then leveling off, and then what comes out in the other end is something that the market always wanted, but didn't really know that it wanted. Something like one of the examples is plant based foods. Plant based foods it was a need in the consumer space, and it showed up over the last few years and we are riding the wave.
Dr. Fayaz Khazi, Elo Life Systems:And then the second part is, I want to emphasize that science or the biology of the plant has never been the bottleneck, but still in this day and age we still continue to believe that there are certain bottlenecks, technological bottlenecks. I think that's a personal bias in those of us who are in the industry and those of us who are in the sciences who believe those, but that's changing. And then the third part is the lack of or improving situations in terms of harmonization of regulatory guidelines across the globe. So to me, those are the three different things that always show up on my radar every time the bottleneck question is up on the table.
Dr. Haven Baker, Pairwise:We got lots of good ideas, and more good ideas than we know what to do with. Our primary bottleneck is that just like in breeding, a raspberry breeding program is not a strawberry breeding program, which is not a pineapple breeding program. Each of these crops, and sometimes each variety, requires its own CRISPR system. And that tech development is a couple of years of work, and it's maybe as much as a dozen scientists or more getting that right. And so we see this crop by crop, and all of that technology has already been developed in the row crops by the big Ag companies, but for fruits and vegetables each one of these is different.
Dr. Haven Baker, Pairwise:And sometimes a university have done this before like in strawberries, and sometimes there's been absolutely no effort and the companies have to do that from scratch, but each crop is a different system and for us it's a primary technology development area right now. We're on track where we've developed those technologies.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:Hey Haven, I'll pick on you on this one a little bit. When I look at it from where I sit since I'm no longer in a technology company, I'm concerned about the market pull through of these products. And so when you look at are retailers going to carry the products? Are consumers going to accept the products? Kind of going into the social license part of it. In the products, the produce products that you're developing, is there a concern that there's not going to be pull through? Or how do you think about that?
Dr. Haven Baker, Pairwise:I don't know, do you actually like the pits in cherries Vonnie? We're actually not that concerned. I think there needs to be a clear benefit, and you need to be transparent, and so let me give you another example. We're working on a seedless blackberry among blackberries, and we're getting the taste right too so it tastes really good, but we've surveyed blackberry buyers and 85% of them do not like the seeds. There's a few people who like the crunch, every once in a while someone says I really like to chew on them, but most people don't like them. And then there are a bunch of other consumers that won't buy because they get their seeds or maybe they have diverticulitis or something.
Dr. Haven Baker, Pairwise:So our goal is to expand these markets, but I think that you're right, that you have to have a clear benefit, and if you have a clear benefit I don't think they'll be an issue. Now, the overall technology acceptance, it is new this time and it does help that gene editing is not GMO. So this is another breeding technique, it's not GMO, at least in the U.S and most of South America, Australia and Japan, and so we've got really good alignment, but this just get back to is the benefit really there for consumers to try something new?
Vonnie Estes, PMA:Yeah, I think that's really the case, and we've talked about this in the industry a lot about some of the early traits in GMOs, but if you have a benefit that consumers really want, I think that changes the conversation. And I think we were talking about bananas that both other companies are working on, and if you're going to save the banana industry just like we saved the papaya industry, I think those become different conversations. And I think that's really we need kind of the killer app. Why so much emphasis on consumer needs rather than agronomic needs of growers?
Gilad Gershon, Tropic Biosciences:I'm happy to address it. I think that it really addresses your earlier comment about the market pull. I think that when we think about the value chain of some of these products, we do need to take into consideration the different components of it. So you have the growers, you have the processors, and you have the consumers, and the reality is that each one of them seek different types of values. So for example, if we think about disease resistance, or yield it could be very appealing for growers. Whereas, perhaps higher or better nutritional content or with other type of quantity traits is something that's very appealing for consumers.
Gilad Gershon, Tropic Biosciences:And I think that, at least for us, the Holy Grail is trying to combine both. Meaning that if you have a killer type application for the farmers addressing a major need like climate change, drought, diseases, you have a very strong entry point in the market. So perhaps the seed market is smaller than the consumer market, but then you have this very strong call it adoption. If you can, at least in our view, bolt on top of that also a quality type for them it opens up not just the production margin, but also the premium that the consumer can pay, that can be incredibly important.
Gilad Gershon, Tropic Biosciences:I can say that in Tropic Biosciences, I would say probably over the last three years we've dedicated more and more of our time and effort into agronomic traits. Partly because I think it's realistic to assume and over the last year we've seen it come into play more and more, that with climate change the challenges that farmers are going to experience are going to grow more and more. So, at least in our view, I think we are transitioning into a period where people are going to speak more and more about diseases unfortunately, but I think as an industry if we can combine both of these, it's magic.
Dr. Haven Baker, Pairwise:Maybe I'll take a different take on the same question and try to be brief. I look at the salad industry and we're getting ready to bring some new products to market so I've been buying everything that's out there and bringing it home. And my kids, and I got a bunch of kids, flat out tell me, ""I do not want to eat anything with cabbage in it, I want Caesar salad."" And so we want to bring healthy green, but all they want is romaine. I mean, they do the iceberg if we let them too, but this gets to this disconnect that our mission is to increase fruits and vegetable consumption, we're trying to grow the category and grow the industry.
Dr. Haven Baker, Pairwise:And so that's probably a place to start with the consumer first. The other thing is the technology is expensive now. 10 years from now the technology will be quite a bit cheaper, and maybe we can work on these diseases that happen every other year, but finding a consistent problem that will still be a problem in five years after you spend all this money developing products, that's an important point and I think the consumer is a much better place to start with that than probably the farmer.
Dr. Fayaz Khazi, Elo Life Systems:I would agree with both you guys. And also as a slight qualifier, climate change is something that's here now, and we've been talking about HLB, and we've been talking about Fusarium PR4, and Pierce's disease in grapes and what have you, so those are big binary questions. Your consumer has decided at this point based on all the surveys and all the data, there is a technology pull, there is a need for technology to solve these problems. And therefore, we are in the space. On the flip side, our zero melon program for example, there is also a hybrid need for a natural zero calorie sweetener that we are producing in watermelon at scale to get over the bottlenecks of utilization of monk fruit based sweeteners in beverages and food items.
Dr. Fayaz Khazi, Elo Life Systems:So that's where I think the the consumer pull will then instigate or initiate an inquiry, but then input traits, agronomic traits, and what have you, based on the demand that we create on the consumer side. What I'm trying to say is, they are not independent of each other, it is which one pulls the other and at what time? And it depends on the crop, it depends on the time of day, and depends on the market segment.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:Yeah, I would add to that, just as my experience of working for a lot of technology companies in the '90s. Is that one of the things that I think we realized is how important it is to bring the consumers along in this conversation. And I think in some of the early products that were genetically modified with grower traits, the consumers felt like they weren't getting the benefit, and they felt like they were taking a risk. And so I think a lot of the focus with gene editing is just been to to make sure that consumers understand and that they're getting this amazing benefit that technology is bringing to them in a safe way.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:So those of us who showed the scars of early genetic modification, I think this is a way to make sure that consumers are brought along. What do you think will be the future of agriculture related with the farmer's adoption of genetically modified crops being based on GMOs or gene editing? Will both coexist in the market, or GMOs are going to be displaced sooner or later?
Dr. Haven Baker, Pairwise:I think in produce you won't see GMOs. One, they're too small of markets, there are some things that gene editing can't do, right now. I mean, Gilad is actually more cutting edge on this with insect resistance, but insects resistance right now is a GMO trait and I'm not sure you can create that with gene editing, maybe you can someday. But I think with produce with the small crops will want to stay gene edited, there's plenty of innovation to be done there and it'll be a long time. So row crops, it's probably going to be a mixture of technologies.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:Yeah.
Gilad Gershon, Tropic Biosciences:I mean, we need to build on that and absolutely I agree with that. I think that what is likely, and I'm going to change this differentiation between genetic and GMO is the time and cost to market. So GMO with the regulatory requirement it will always be more expensive to make, and if we think about produce the likelihood that some of these GM type traits is going to make any return on its investment is low. So absolutely agree with Haven's analysis that something very catastrophic will need to happen in order to justify a GM trait, and you mentioned the papaya which is one good example to that. Well, in row crops it can justify it, there's GM trait that cannot be created using gene editing, and it does have a return on the investment over long terms. These two things can coexist.
Dr. Fayaz Khazi, Elo Life Systems:Yeah. I think in the near future based on where we are with the secure rule and whatnot, those two categories will blend into one products of biotechnology category. And that is we won't see any true transgenics, but you might see a blending of editing and GMO recycled elements from the past GMO components very soon.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:Here's a question, I love this question, and none of us know the answer for sure, but I'd love to hear your opinions. We currently see the wonders of gene editing and science in the medical field with the COVID vaccine, but yet even with this science and its success we are seeing public resistance. What can the food industry learn from the COVID vaccine experience?
Dr. Haven Baker, Pairwise:You're not going to keep everyone happy. I think maybe another aspect of some of our consumer studies that will be obvious to some people in industry, but maybe not to everyone. Which is that when you go study a produce buyer and you want to study them, we would study it by berries, or in the past did it by potatoes, there's a percentage of the population that wants to know everything, right? Every last detail you can possibly get, they want to know all the information.
Dr. Haven Baker, Pairwise:And sometimes those are your organic buyers where it might be 10 or 15% of the population, but there's another 50% of population that don't want to know anything. They just want to buy a product, not engage with it emotionally and enjoy it, keep it simple. And so I think that that's one of the challenges we have with all these new technologies. It doesn't matter whether it's self driving cars, or AI, or better iPhones, is how do you satisfy an audience or a customer segment where one part of the population is never satisfied with the information, and a lot a large portion don't really want to engage, they just want to enjoy their item and move on with their lives?
Dr. Haven Baker, Pairwise:And so I think that that'll be one of the challenges that we'll continuously have in this fields and others is getting the appropriate level of communication to the right audiences. And maybe that we were in a pandemic, I don't think that quite happened this last go around. We tended to over saturate some of these markets with too much information, or the wrong information or too early information that we got pushback.
Dr. Fayaz Khazi, Elo Life Systems:I would agree. And part of it is what we are trying to avoid is to get into that conversation, because it's very difficult, it's the situation to please 100% of the consumers. And therefore what we are trying to address are these big, hairy problems where there is a massive technology pull. And I think in those kinds of situations, the question always is it's like I mentioned before, it's a binary thing. Would you rather go without bananas? Or would you rather go without natural zero calorie sweetener? Or do something else? Or live at status quo?
Dr. Fayaz Khazi, Elo Life Systems:And in those kinds of scenarios for us, I think two components come into the picture. One is the commercializing entity or our partners become a big component of that data and keeping the consumers happy and satisfied. And then the second part is for us, what we have learned over the COVID period is that there are technological solutions for any kind of problems. Yes, it may not make 100% of the consumers happy, but those are viable solutions, and we have seen this over the last year and a half that it is a life saving approach the COVID vaccine.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:So a number of people in the chat saw the New York Times article that was in the New York Times Magazine on Sunday, and would like to know what your reaction to that article is and what reaction you've gotten. And in the article, it's a great article I recommend anyone read it, Pairwise is interviewed, so Haven why don't we start with you and see what reaction you've gotten from the article, what you thought of the article, and then we'll hear from the other two panelists.
Dr. Haven Baker, Pairwise:I think that overwhelmingly, the response we've received has been positive, and I think there's two levels of that. One is the reporter that wrote it was interested in the products they're writing and also Kathy Martins and some of these others. So the products you'd start with there's some signals that products are interesting, which is great market feedback or pre-market feedback. The other piece is that an institution like the New York Times which has an incredible reach, is willing to engage on the conversation in general.
Dr. Haven Baker, Pairwise:I think that's a very positive signal for this field. So it's been overwhelmingly positive from our perspective, and I think maybe the last thing is, is that we do think transparency is really, really important both for the consumer and the public in general. And I think you'll see some of that paying off as if you can be as open as you can be, that people recognize the sincerity and it's easier to get to these benefits without the secrecy.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:Any other comments on the article? Positive or negative?
Dr. Fayaz Khazi, Elo Life Systems:It was a great read and it was a very well written article, and congratulations to Haven and his team for great coverage. And I think it's an overall great win for the industry, because it's the next level of dialogue, right? It is not about whether or not this is good, dangerous or safe, it is what is the benefit? And how are the industries and the consumers and the companies all taking the technology forward into products of the future? So to me, I welcome the article.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:Yeah, I thought it was really fantastic and really put a human face and human stories, and it's a way when you look at how do we communicate to consumers about this type of technology? This is a great way to do it with colorful pictures and personal stories and benefits, so I really welcomed it. So this is a great question, why is this not considered GMO in the U.S? And are there countries where it is considered GMO?
Dr. Haven Baker, Pairwise:The difference here is for most the world, outside Europe, and I guess New Zealand, that if you're using foreign DNA, so DNA that didn't come from the species or the family you're working on, it's considered GMO. If it could have breeding it's just being done faster, then it's like many of the other technologies that we are already using like DNA chips and things like that. It's just a laboratory methods to make breeding faster, and that's what makes it non-GMO. It's really that there's nothing there's no more foreign material left in the plant.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:There's a number of questions around transparency and communication. And this is certainly a conversation that's happening in the industry of if you're using gene editing, and this is for the U.S, and you don't right now it's not considered GMO. How do we communicate with consumers? The consumers want to know given the choice, is there going to be a code? Is there going to be a sticker? What will happen when gene edited products in the produce industry hit the market?
Dr. Haven Baker, Pairwise:Well, since we're going to go first, I'll say all our products are going to be branded. So it's not only going to be differentiate it's going to be branded, and we probably won't have the big technology story in the package, that'll be on the website, but it'll be transparent and clear. And so I think I can't say for other approaches, but initially that's one of the reasons we're going to have branded produce.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:That makes sense.
Dr. Fayaz Khazi, Elo Life Systems:It's got to be and I don't know Haven, is you're innate potato website still on? Do you know?
Dr. Haven Baker, Pairwise:I haven't checked it in a few months.
Dr. Fayaz Khazi, Elo Life Systems:No, I really liked what you guys did there back when you were at Simplot, there was a link and think there was a QR code you could go in and that would open up the website, and in there they had all the details of the technology. But I think that way, those who are seeking details or the information that's available to them, but you don't want to have too many technical details printed on the label or whatever. But that's how we are looking at our zero melon product, and also our chickpea products as well.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:So you would have some kind of a QR code or some kind of link where people could find out, but if they picked up the product to buy it, they wouldn't necessarily know? I'm just clarifying.
Dr. Fayaz Khazi, Elo Life Systems:I think it would be clearly labeled that it's a product of genome editing. And how exactly it was edited, and what was edited, and what was changed, and all the details, whether this would have been a natural change or whatever would be available on our website.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:I've got a great comment here from someone from Del Monte saying that they're not seeing any consumer resistance on the pink pineapple.
Dr. Fayaz Khazi, Elo Life Systems:Absolutely.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:So I didn't know that, that's great to hear. I still haven't had one, anyone want to send me one I'll take it, but they look great.
Gilad Gershon, Tropic Biosciences:But maybe that's a good example of communication. I think that eventually, I think all of the different products that the companies represented here and others we're working are quite valuable and things that we're very proud in, and again, the Del Monte pink pineapple, which is delicious and I think is a phenomenal product, are the same. So I think maybe instead of thinking about it as being very defensive and saying this is what... Being in a position where we need to explain as to defend our product, I think we can be in a position where we can be very proud and say this product was developed using gene editing and it allows you to be more nutritious.
Gilad Gershon, Tropic Biosciences:Or we saved a lot of chemicals, or we allowed for use of less water in production, so there are ways to address that. Again, good example of that and someone mentioned in the Q&A, the Arctic Apple from Okanagan. I think that the way that they explain it on the packaging was this is a GMO apple, but if we didn't make this apple non-brown using genetics, we would have used to use like sulfate et cetera so it's your choice. And people buy that Apple, it's a good Apple.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:If it takes 10 years or so for a new gene edited product to get to market given the costs and the licenses et cetera, is the pain worth the gain versus just best plant breeding?
Dr. Fayaz Khazi, Elo Life Systems:Depends on the crop, first of all. Some might take 10 years and some might take four years. And then the pain versus gain also depends on the crop and the market. So, for example bananas, we hope to get to resistance trait very quickly, but the scaling up and adoption of that in the plantations is going to take some time, right? So that's the reality of the industry. On the same note, if you develop something that's suited for vertical farm, let's say you're developing a trait in lettuce or everything there now Pairwise is doing or Topic is doing in that space, that could take a shorter period of time. So either way, I think if you have a successful consumer focused trait, or a quality trait, I'm in the business because I do believe that the pain is worth the gain.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:Even if these new gene edited products have attractive consumer traits, big retailers will still need to trial them and they have been written reticent to do this with GMO, how will you change this? And do you think this is an issue?
Dr. Haven Baker, Pairwise:It's interesting. I mean, I think that that question is well framed, but I think the other examples of tech food have grown quite rapidly, whether it's the plant based milks or the Impossible Burger, or things like that. And I mean that's maybe an older view in the world and different retailers will be different, but when we do our consumer surveys and we look at all the other new tech enhanced foods we think this is absolutely on trend, and the innovation will be important. And frankly, you'll want to start with places where produce is important for the retailers, where it's not just about cost, it's about driving a better consumer experience.
Gilad Gershon, Tropic Biosciences:Maybe another benefit in this regard of gene editing is the precision. I think that when you try to bring something that's absolutely different from everything that everyone used to consume, there's a lot less certainty. But when we think about genetic traits, a lot of the time these are very, very clear and very well defined. So for example, you can have exactly the same fruit that everyone is used to, the same size, color and even the taste and maybe you only change one nutrient in it or a disease resistance. So it's a much more controlled change, and to some degree what we're seeing is that it creates more confidence from the industry itself.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:How will you access germplasm and hybrid varieties? Do you consider collaborating or partnering with fruit and vegetable or other seed companies? So quick answer on that from each of you.
Dr. Fayaz Khazi, Elo Life Systems:Our business model is entirely based on partnering, so we access through our partners and we work only on elite germplasm and nothing else.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:Thanks.
Gilad Gershon, Tropic Biosciences:I think for us, when we select the crops that we focus on and develop from zero and eventually become dominant players within these crops, we actually look for crops where we can access not just an elite germplasm, but also the distribution without being in the door or connected in the hip to a single provider. We feel that that creates... It doesn't lend itself to healthy margins long term, so I think that venturing into crops where there is a few dominant players that own the germplasm is a challenging in itself. So there's a lot of crops outside that can be addressed.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:Okay, Haven wrapping up.
Dr. Haven Baker, Pairwise:Yeah, real quick. So sometimes elite means bad tasting in produce, right? Where they're high yielding, but they don't taste good. And so we're absolutely part of the germplasm, but we want to bring the best tasting fruit and vegetables forward that we can get. And so we'll actually sacrifice on yield if we have to a little bit to bring that great taste on with the genetic because it doesn't do any good to bring some new attribute, but have the produce not taste good. And that's generally something I should say maybe that gene editing is not doing is enhancing flavor, that's still way too complicated. What we're really doing is adding some other benefit or maybe reducing a negative and so that germplasm selection is really, really important to bring that consumer experiences, make it as positive as it can be.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:Great, thank you. I hope you found that episode as fascinating as I did. Gene editing is a precise breeding tool that will help solve many of the problems we are facing today, along with delivering more convenient and tasty fruits and vegetables. Please let me know if you have additional questions or are looking for more resources on the topic. We want consumers to gain the value of the technology to both them and the environment and be able to make informed choices.

Vonnie Estes, PMA:Today, we will hear a recording of a fireside chat I had with Nate Storey, the chief science officer of Plenty at the 16th Annual Canadian Summit on Food Safety 2021. At the end of the conversation, you will hear a Q and A that I think you will find interesting and was worth leaving in. We will talk about food safety at Plenty and in the CEA space. When indoor ag was first getting going years ago, many companies, not saying Plenty was one of them, positioned indoor ag is us versus them, them being outdoor growers. And that indoor was better on many dimensions, food safety being one of the big ones. Plenty and most of the other indoor companies talk now about growing the pie, that producing more fruits and vegetables in different ways is better for everyone, indoor and out. Nate talks about the problems both sectors face in transparency, technology adoption, and labor. Let's jump into this very candid discussion about food safety and technology.
Nate Storey, Plenty:My name is Nate Storey, and I'm one of the co-founders at Plenty. Plenty is an indoor farming company. So we grow food indoors under artificial light. These are in big warehouses basically. And we're able to condense a lot of production into a very small amount of space. So we got started because we felt like we needed to grow the world's capacity to grow fresh fruits and vegetables. In the United States, we're incredibly blessed. We have a lot of farm land. We have a lot of agricultural capacity. Other parts of the world, not quite as fortunate. And as we start to think about a global population that's much larger than it is today, the need for fresh fruits and vegetables is only going to grow, but the capacity that we have today, running full bore 100%, for the next decades won't be able to keep up with that demand.
Nate Storey, Plenty:So that's why we started Plenty. To meet that demand with this new source of supply. Yeah, so our farms are very large. We're growing on these vertical planes. It looks like you took a field and you stood it on its edge and put another field back-to-back with it. And these are very big, very complex farms, but they're pretty awesome. They allow us to control everything. The environment's completely controlled. Our day length is controlled, nutrients. We're able to exclude pests. We're able to collect a lot of data in keeping with the theme of these conversations. And we're able to understand a lot about plant growth in our systems and produce a product that's really pretty great day in and day out. So we produce that product and we sell it and people get the same thing every single day when they buy a Plenty product.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:What are you growing? Let people what crops are you growing now and what crops are you planning on growing in the next couple of years.
Nate Storey, Plenty:Yeah. So right now we're mostly focused on leafy greens. Most folks in the space start with leafy greens because they feel like an easy crop to grow. You're focusing on that primary production, but we have been working very hard on strawberries. We've got a partnership with Driscoll's developing strawberries for indoor production. We've been working very hard on tomatoes. We've got a few other crops like raspberries and a few other things in the works. So I anticipate we're going to be taking a lot of new crops to the world over the next few years.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:And how many farms do you have now?
Nate Storey, Plenty:So right now we have three farming sites. So we have basically our R&D farm. This is our advanced research facility in Laramie, Wyoming. And there we have around 50 discrete environments that we use for plant research. These are relatively small production spaces, but other people call them farms. I think we'll just call the whole complex a farm site. You've got the South San Francisco farm, which is our pilot and we're growing there in South San Francisco and distributing to a number of sources throughout the Bay Area. And we're in currently in the process of building the Compton farm, which is the first instance of this very, very large farm. It's also probably the smallest farm we'll ever built.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:Oh, interesting. And when are you projecting that will be completed in Compton?
Nate Storey, Plenty:We'll be finishing that up towards the end of this year and bringing it online. Yeah.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:Great. So this conference is about food safety. How do you think about food safety at Plenty?
Nate Storey, Plenty:Yeah. Food safety is something that we spend a lot of time and money and attention on. I think it's become one of these things which is one of these top concerns for consumers. And when they buy product, it used to be the assumption is this is a safe product. I think that that's still generally true, but there's been a lot of food safety recalls. There's been a lot of things in the news lately that I think have people questioning safety. And so at Plenty, we recognize that that's one of the most important things that we can be focused on. I will say, we've got a fundamentally different kind of problem compared to folks who are growing in uncontrolled environment.
Nate Storey, Plenty:So you look at a lot of the food safety recalls of the last few years, and a lot of them had nothing to do with best practices in some instances, right? Or they're totally uncontrolled things, right? You've got a wild boar that walks through a field and poops, right? How do you control for that? So at Plenty we have a very different scenario, that a wild boar can't walk through our farm, right? Because it is inside of a building. It's locked. People are using key cards to get in and out of the farm. They're gowned up from head to toe. We're able to practice really excellent exclusion practices. So keeping pests and pathogens out altogether. So I guess all of that to say, it's a very different problem that we have to solve compared to someone who is still trying to grow in the field and trying to keep wild boars out, right?
Nate Storey, Plenty:So all of that to say, we think a lot about prevention and risk management, sanitization, exclusion, cleanliness, all of the components that keep our produce very, very clean. Human hands don't touch this stuff because we've automated many of our processes in an effort to eliminate all of the potential points of contamination in the growing and processing process. We practice really good traceability so that if something ever does go wrong we know where and how. And then we've got testing and analysis that's quite aggressive. And I guess the thing that I'd say there is testing is getting a lot better. But testing and traceability go hand in hand because you don't want to be using traceability to try and find the source of a problem that's exposed by food your consumers are eating.
Nate Storey, Plenty:You want to be testing really aggressively hand in hand with traceability so that you can catch anything before it ever occurs. And I guess the last thing I'd add is, again, in keeping with this idea that we've got a very different... In some ways a much simpler problem to solve. Our supply chain is not complicated. There aren't a whole lot of handoffs, right? Traceability can be hard when you've got lots and lots of handoffs, when there's a lot of on process changing hands, 14 times in some instances if you're a field grower. For us, we drive it directly to the distribution center or directly to the store and it's a single handoff. So traceability for us is much simpler. It has more to do with process steps than it does to do with who had it, right? Who had it at this point in the process.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:Do you think that's going to get more complicated as you get bigger and you have more farms? Is that going to become more complex and how will you deal with that?
Nate Storey, Plenty:I mean, I think managing those farms becomes more complex and the number of instances grows because we now have more farms. But as far as the actual process, the process itself doesn't get more complex. So if you think about it this way, if I was growing in a field and I had a farm in California and I'm managing multiple fields but we're aggregating all of that produce with the packing, at the packing stage and then shipping it out and it changes hands half a dozen times across half a dozen different retailers and ends up in stores all over the US, that's still quite complicated.
Nate Storey, Plenty:Whereas with the Plenty farms, because we're very close, generally, relatively close to the distribution centers, each farm is going to be servicing certain distribution centers, certain stores. So when you look at it kind of like the nodes, if you were to diagram it out, farm to distribution center, distribution center to stores compared to the insane logistics problems that many of the field growers have to manage, where it's a hard, hard problem. Our problems are relatively simple. There's just not that many exchanges, right? There's not that many transactions.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:Yeah. That makes sense. Are there any problems that Plenty or anyone else that's in controlled environment ag has around food safety that are different than outside? Are there problems that are more unique to CEA growing around food safety?
Nate Storey, Plenty:Yeah. I mean, I think if there are, they're more around process steps, but even then I don't think that indoor necessarily has any more or any less problems. I think that's simplification of the idea of how pathogens could get into the system. Everyone has to be vigilant. Everyone has to be really careful. The difference is the simplicity of the system, right? And the ability to measure. So I think if there's one thing that's probably true for indoor growers or Plenty at least is we tend to over-index on testing. So because we have this super tight contained facility, because we have these really well-defined process steps, we're able to test with more frequency and more often. And one of the drawbacks of testing is that you learn things, right?
Vonnie Estes, PMA:Yeah. Yeah.
Nate Storey, Plenty:You actually have to do something with that data. And so I think the reality is we just have a much more granular view of say the microbiology of the system. And even in systems that are super sterile, there's always a microbiology no matter what. Germ theory, everything is everywhere, right? And the reality is that no matter where you go, no matter what kind of a system you're working with, there will always be a microbiology. So we just need to make sure it's the right microbiology. Is it safe? Is it a good microbiology? And so all of that to say, I think for a lot of field growers, the testing equipment just doesn't exist to engage in the kind of testing that we can engage in, in a controlled facility with a lab onsite, right?
Nate Storey, Plenty:It's a different scenario. And I think that lack of information in the field both represents a risk in terms of not necessarily always knowing what is in or on your product. It also mitigates the risk of knowing and having to respond to it, right? We just don't have enough historical data to understand how we balance our reaction to some of these things in the field. So often times we end up with these scenarios where it lands on a shelf and some gets sick, and then they do a bunch of testing and we've got big recall on our hands. It's definitely worse in the long run than testing in the field and understanding what's going on and just holding stuff back.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:So what did you have to do? I hadn't even thought of this. That because your ability to constantly test and you're able to see things at a much lower level and to follow them through, what did you have to learn and was there anybody else doing that research? Or did you just have to build this whole body of research yourself of really understanding, ""We've never seen this pathogen or this microorganism""? It's not necessarily a pathogen, maybe pathogen to the plant, but just that whole body of knowledge probably didn't exist before you started looking, right?
Nate Storey, Plenty:Yeah. I mean, so people have been doing research on the microbiology of hydroponic systems for a while. That being said, every little ecosystem is different, no two are alike. They can be the exact same system side-by-side and they might have a slightly different microbiology. So some existed, and it was helpful in a very broad sense and unhelpful in a narrow sense. So there's just a lot that we have to learn about our farms, right? How they behave, how they work. And they're very safe. They're very safe in terms of the microbiology that we have. They tend to be closer to the sterile end of the spectrum than the super diverse into the spectrum.
Nate Storey, Plenty:And that's frankly the way we want it. We clean the floors, we sterilize the equipment between harvest, right? We're sterilizing everything. So that's how we want it. That's not necessarily to say that it's a good or a bad thing. That's just the management approach that we've taken. And learning how that impacts food safety, learning how that impacts the microbiology of the system has been quite the learning process for us. We are fortunate to have a system that allows us to collect data constantly, test constantly, and really keep tabs on the system microbiology, as opposed to more of the black box approach that frankly we're stuck with in a lot of other production systems.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:And you have everything all in one place too, which has got to be a big advantage. So you're growing and any processing, any packaging, anything, it's not moving across town or it doesn't have to go through a bunch of different steps.
Nate Storey, Plenty:That's right.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:So that control has got to be a huge advantage from a food safety point of view as well.
Nate Storey, Plenty:Yeah. Again, just going back to this concept of simplification, right? It's like when you simplify the problem, there's only, say two transactions rather than 15 transactions. The number of places where something can go wrong, or the number of points where there can be contamination or the number of processes to audit, or what have you, right? It's a fraction. It's a fraction of what it is otherwise. So we just have a simpler problem.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:Yeah. You've talked a little bit about traceability. So let's move a little bit about traceability and data. So how can traceability and enhanced data transparency make the CEA sector more responsive to food safety concerns?
Nate Storey, Plenty:Yeah. That's a good question. I mean, I think the thing to point out about traceability is traceability is typically used to try and understand where a problem happened after the fact, right?
Vonnie Estes, PMA:That's awful.
Nate Storey, Plenty:It's kind of like the police, right? They show up after the crime has been committed. If you're the person getting robbed, the cops aren't that helpful in that moment, right? And so traceability is the same way. Usually something has happened and we've got a recall, we've got something on our hands and we've got to go back and figure out in the produce industry, right? So at Plenty, we've taken a little bit of a different approach and we've said traceability is very helpful in terms of food safety, yes, and always managing our food safety, but it's also very helpful at managing our system and our system efficiency.
Nate Storey, Plenty:So for us traceability is as much about system efficiency and material management as it is about human health and safety. And I think the thing to point out there is in most systems traceability again, is something that's helpful generally after the fact. At Plenty because we're able to pair it with this testing, right? Constant testing, just constant, constant, constant testing, it becomes a tool for really rapid diagnosis if we see something that's weird or off, or if we see a shift in system microbiology, or if we see ATP counts go up somewhere, right? So we basically have a unique opportunity to leverage traceability. And the other thing that I'd say is we've simplified the traceability problem at Plenty with our architecture, right?
Nate Storey, Plenty:So it's not like we're coming into an existing system that's already complex and trying to bring a traceability system to try and understand a super complicated thing. We basically just said, ""Hey, what's the more simple form, right? How do we get to a more simple form?"" And that doesn't make the traceability obsolete per se, but it does make it maybe a little less critical to understanding the system, right? Because the system is just more understandable. It is simple. There's only a couple of transactions there. I guess that's how I would describe our approach to traceability. Consumers want honesty, consumers want transparency, consumers want to know that their food is safe.
Nate Storey, Plenty:And I think we've used labels for a very long time to try and communicate those things, but I see a world and a future where consumers want to be able to scan a barcode and see how the product was grown, scan a barcode and see who grew it, where it was grown, how it was handed off, whether or not it was cold chain compliant or not. I see a future where people want to be able to take more of a firsthand approach to auditing the food that they eat. I don't think that's everyone, but I think that's an occasional thing that people want. And in a world where we're moving towards more transparency, I'd bet on it rather than bet against it.
Nate Storey, Plenty:So regardless of the system that folks are using to produce, traceability is something they should be investing in. I will also say the fact that we have some of the food safety incidents on the rise, I think in my opinion indicates we need to invest in more testing as well. So in the same vein as pairing testing and traceability for field producers, that's something that we need, is rapid modular testing.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:Mm-hmm (affirmative). So we've been at a huge time of disruption with COVID and then some regulatory changes. How can data make the CEA sector more resilient in these times of disruption?
Nate Storey, Plenty:Yeah. That's a good question. I think there's a lot of things that we can learn from the last year and a half as it relates to resiliency and the food supply system. Some of those things have to do with things like traceability and data, knowing what is where, right? There were all sorts of logistics breakdowns the last year. And a lot of that is a data problem. A lot of that was a labor problem, right? In some places we just didn't have the people. So investing in more autonomous systems or systems that can basically function in the absence of human supervisors, that's important.
Nate Storey, Plenty:And then location. So at Plenty our goal has been to solve these by putting farms close to distribution centers, minimizing the amount of labor, minimizing the amount of complexity that can interfere with us, growing the product and then handing it directly off to the retailer and then they hand it off directly to the consumer, that's the simplest possible process, right? And so when we think about resilient food systems, I think it's important to think about simple food systems. Could we just make these super complex things a little bit complicated and reduce the number of dependencies in the system? So if we're dependent on constant labor prices and constant labor supply, that's not a good bet looking forward.
Nate Storey, Plenty:The other thing I think really changed was consumers started to think about their health and they started to think about their safety, and maybe they're thinking about it through the lens of COVID, but I think that it's going to transfer to the things that people choose to put in their bodies, to the food that they eat. And as people moved home, we saw it in our sales. Our sales went through the roof, right? As people started staying home and started cooking for themselves, they started investing in healthy food. And I think understanding what they're eating, who grew, where it came from is an important part of that decision making process for some folks. And certainly the folks that are the advocates, right? The folks that are quite vocal and the folks that are really involved with promoting fresh fruits and vegetables, fresh, healthy food.
Nate Storey, Plenty:So I think consumer behavior is another thing to consider here and the speed of change in that behavior. A lot of things happened overnight with COVID. And I think we need to get used to consumer demands, for change. Consumer demands for things being something that we have to respond to. So when we think about data systems and how flexible they are responsive, how we're able to audit, where something was and who was touching it and who handed it off, that's another thing to keep in mind looking forward. So all of that to say, it's just a long ramble there. We have this tendency as humans to engage in this additive improvement, right? So we're like, ""Oh, we've got to figure out how to make the system safer. Let's add things to it."" And what that results in is a super complex system.
Nate Storey, Plenty:And it gets to the point where we just hold out this, ""Hope machine learning AI is going to come in and solve this problem for us. It's too complicated for humans now."" And maybe the question doesn't need to be too complicated for humans, right? At its core, do we really need to make this thing so complex that we need insanely complex computer programs to actually help us understand it? And I think the answer at Plenty is no. As we start to think about how we grow the world's capacity to grow fresh fruits and vegetables, I think we can grow that capacity with a simpler system, with a system that empowers producers, empowers consumers and really makes it something that's understandable.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:Yeah. Those are a bunch of different great points. I think certainly around consumers it's very important. And we at PMA we've seen a lot of changes in consumers and how they want to get their food and how they think about their food. And I know for myself personally, in the beginning of COVID where we went to the grocery store a lot less frequently, just the decision of what do you buy because I'm not coming back for 10 more days. And so those types of behaviors and looking at how long will this lettuce last on my refrigerator, or how long will this strawberry last in my refrigerator? And so I think just those types of changes in behavior and people wanting to buy online and have it delivered, we saw an ability to really be able to react to those types of things.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:And I think that made for a lot more resilience. And at the same time, a lot of consumers really got to see what does our supply chain look like when there was people plowing onions back and in the field because they couldn't go to food service or milk being dumped. I think that really highlighted to a lot of consumers what our supply chain looks like and how important it is on food.
Nate Storey, Plenty:Yeah.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:Yeah.
Nate Storey, Plenty:And we were all really in the hands of these complicated logistics, right? And anyone could produce or could be the victim.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:Yeah.
Nate Storey, Plenty:Any group with consumers could be the victim of inefficiencies that jump out.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:Yeah. So what technology do you see still needs to be developed to decrease the number of food safety recalls and produce? And this can be indoor or outdoor grown. Just what do you think we should be working on from a technology point of view to solve this better?
Nate Storey, Plenty:Yeah. I mean, I think for me there's probably three things that matter the most. And I harp on this with my teams a lot, right? You have to make something easier, people won't do it. You have to make it easy or people will take shortcuts and do it wrong or they'll figure out some way to cheat the system to make it easier. So human beings are always optimizing for conservation of energy. So I think number one is testing and I'm still amazed at the lack of really effective testing for pathogens that exist. So-
Vonnie Estes, PMA:Onsite testing.
Nate Storey, Plenty:Onsite. That's right. In the field. So starting in the field, right? Again, traceability is fine. Traceability is great, but it just tells you what is and it's usually after the fact. And so it tells you where something was. It doesn't necessarily tell you the state of the product at that position in the supply chain. So when we think about the fundamental problem here, it's like no one knows whether there's pathogens on the product or not until late in the game. And so if we had modular testing, they could go to the fields, it could be very effective. That would be awesome.
Nate Storey, Plenty:We at Plenty we've got the advantage of we've got a lab on site, right? We have the lab in the field, if you will. And I think for us, that's awesome. It means that we can do that rapid testing. It means that we can understand what is true and we can walk anywhere in the farm and tell you what the state of that product is. But for the field which needs to keep producing to meet demand, testing is so, so important. And there just aren't any great solutions today that are rapid, modular and really effective. And then second on traceability, this is just a super simple thing, but automated data entry.
Nate Storey, Plenty:Just figure out ways to make data entry automated, fast, effective, easy for people. And the folks especially who are in the field, this is the last thing that they want to think about. Make it easy. So this is technology that already exists, RFID tags, barcodes, the systems around managing and tracking things. And then I think lastly integrated data systems. So getting people to share their data and building data systems that transfer. Before we were talking about blockchain, but these ways of understanding where something came from in a way that's integrated, retailers, producers, everyone.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:So these aren't Nobel Prize level technology discoveries. These are mostly adoption and just paying attention to putting solutions together that people can use, right?
Nate Storey, Plenty:These are not sexy.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:Yeah. That's the area that people don't want to invest in, I'm afraid, but...
Nate Storey, Plenty:Yeah.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:Well, I think we have some questions from the audience, right? Beth, were you going to [crosstalk 00:31:47] those? Yeah. Okay.
Beth:We do. So the first question comes in from Sean Moore who asked, ""What forms of technology does Plenty use today?
Nate Storey, Plenty:Oh, that's a really big question. I mean, we're a technology company and so there are a lot of technologies that we use that we don't work on. So think industrial robots, industrial controls, that kind of thing. There's a lot of technology that we've developed because it's either something the market didn't provide or couldn't provide for our specific application. So these are things like, I would say our growing technology, vertical towers and the conveyance systems and just the way that we manage things, the architecture itself of the farm. We have lighting systems that we've designed, HVAC systems, air management, environmental management systems.
Nate Storey, Plenty:We have nutrient and fluids control systems. Then we have genetics, which I consider technology. It's proprietary genetics that we've paired to match with those environmental technologies. And then on top of genetics there's the classic GEM, right? We've layered all of these management technologies that we've developed in order to help make sure that that match of genetics and environment is perfect. So farmOS, sensor and sensing systems. We're using machine learning and AI in some instances, data management storage, data pipeline, and that kind of thing. So everything from the hardware to the software and then the plant software of genetics.
Beth:That's a lot. But yeah, it keeps everything moving, that's for sure. So another question came in, how often do you use pesticides in CEA? Is it needs-based only or preventive as well?
Nate Storey, Plenty:Yeah. At Plenty we don't use pesticides on our crops. Again, just going back to this concept of simplicity... I know that's not true for all producers, but for Plenty it is. Going back to this concept of simplicity, right? If you can keep the pests out of the farm then you have a much lessened likelihood of having to use pesticides, right? We do our production cycle, is always about 12 days. And so there are very few pests and pathogens that can keep up with those types of... We just outstripped the life cycle of most of our insects, pests. We don't have weeds. So all we're left with is fungal and bacterial pathogens. And those we control with air filtration and fluids filtration, right? And so we can manage all of the different risks to our crops with means other than pesticides or insecticides.
Beth:Awesome. Thank you. Next question is, are you having a challenge finding enough of the right people to fill this roles at Plenty? Are you partnering with any university programs to ensure the skills needed in the future to allow other companies to get on the indoor farming bandwagon or idea, concept here?
Nate Storey, Plenty:Yeah. I mean, I think the answer to that is yes. And I think there are a lot of young, talented, amazing people that are lined up to work at these places. The job market right now is particularly tough. So yeah, I mean, we could always use more. I'd say that the place where we've historically really struggled is to bring in really great mature growers who had experiences in traditional industry. The reality is, ag-tech is tough because you have agricultural problems and you have this partner in a much more conservative established industry.
Nate Storey, Plenty:And so getting good growers to the door who can come in, have an open-mind and engage with you on new technology is a pretty tough thing. Most growers tend to be more conservative in their outlook and their approach on technology and getting their engagement has been hard. But we're slowly getting there as people start to realize we're a real thing and we're going to be around for awhile. We're getting a little bit more of a response.
Beth:I was going to ask you if it's changing over time and you're seeing more of understanding and acceptance of new ways.
Nate Storey, Plenty:It is. It's slowly getting there. We just keep putting out this message, it's like, we're not here to replace the field. We're here to build agricultural capacity on top of the field. Everyone has to produce. There's no one in the world who can slack off here for the next 50, 60 years. The population of this planet, the rising middle-class, none of those things allows anyone to take a break. So there's good job security in ag moving forward. And I think as people start to realize this isn't a competitive thing where we're going to take out the field growers and we're not competing. As people start to realize that they realize, ""Oh, well, maybe there's an opportunity here for more collaboration. Maybe we can share people and share ideas and get better together."" So we're getting there.
Beth:Well, and one question that comes to my mind too is domestically versus internationally. So is there more or less interest particularly in the EU or in other countries? What's the difference that you might be seeing relative to interest domestically versus internationally?
Nate Storey, Plenty:Yeah. I mean, there are massive differences, some of which are cultural, some of which are societal. Some of which are a direct result of the pattern of development to that area. So when we look across the world, there's interest from everywhere, right? The reality is that the world supply of fresh fruits and vegetables can't keep up with demand. That is a fact. And people are not consuming enough fresh fruits and vegetables. And so when we think about what we have to do, we've got to triple the current supply of fresh fruits and vegetables in order to meet that need. How are we going to do that? Right? And I think everyone's wrapping their heads around that.
Nate Storey, Plenty:Obviously some places in the world are way ahead of us where we have plenty of agricultural capacity. You go to Saudi Arabia, you go to Shanghai, China, you go to Singapore and they're thinking about food security constantly because they don't have our capacity. So for them, this is a no-brainer, right? It just makes perfect sense. So I think there are areas of the world that are going to adopt this very, very quickly. And they're going to be areas of the world that are slower simply because there's less pressure on them from a supply standpoint.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:I think what we're going to see moving forward is a blurring of the lines between indoor and outdoor. We are already seeing partnerships like Plenty and Driscoll's, for example, between outdoor companies and indoor companies. There are both ways to produce food with their own sets of benefits and challenges, which vary by growing regions and crop. We will see growers produce food in ways that are best for them in terms of labor, water, availability, and markets. That's it for this episode of PMA Takes on Tech.

Vonnie Estes, PMA:Welcome to PMA Takes on Tech, the podcast that explores the problems, solutions, people, and ideas that are shaping the future of the produce industry. I'm your host, Vonnie Estes, Vice President of Technology for the Produce Marketing Association. And I've spent years in the ag-tech sector. So I can attest, it's hard to navigate this ever-changing world in developing and adopting new solutions to industry problems. Thanks for joining us and for allowing us to serve as your guide to the new world of produce and technology. My goal of the podcast is to outline a problem in the produce industry and then discuss several possible solutions that can be deployed today.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:This week's podcast is being sponsored by Paine Schwartz Partners. A global leader in sustainable food chain investing, Paine Schwartz Partners is a private equity firm with a demonstrated 20 plus year track record of investments across the food and agribusiness value chain. The firm leverages a thesis-driven approach and operational expertise to enhance value across its portfolio. Please visit www.paineschwartz.com to find out more about the firm and its activities.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:Today we will listen to a conversation I had with Sarah Nolet on her podcast, AgTech So What. Sarah is extremely knowledgeable around all things ag-tech. Along with the podcast, she is a partner with Matthew Pryor and AgThentic, an advisory group, and also Tenacious Ventures. Sarah and Matthew recently announced the final close of their first VC fund, raising $26.8 million from a diverse group of limited partners to target seed and series A rounds. Our conversation spans many areas of mutual interests, from molecular breeding to carbon markets to biologicals and supply chain. Let's jump in.
Sarah Nolet:Hello, and welcome to AgTech So What, brought to you by the AgThentic group. I'm your host, Sarah Nolet. I'm really excited about today's guest, Vonnie Estes. Not only is she an industry leader in food and ag, but she's also refreshingly candid about her own experiences working for large and small ag and food companies. This is Vonnie remembering the U.S. biofuels craze of the mid-2000s.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:They said, ""Build these gigantic plants."" And my job at the time, I was working for DuPont, and I was in charge of a program that we were looking at converting corn stover into fuel. And I had, it was a beaker in a lab. That's where my technology was. It was a beaker fermenting in a lab. And people were saying, ""Here's a check for 100 million dollars. Go build a 100 million gallon ethanol plant."" So it was a lot of push without really looking at the system.
Sarah Nolet:These days, Vonnie is the vice president of technology at the Produce Marketing Association, or PMA. Her role is to help fruit and vegetable growers in industry to adopt and integrate new technologies. Previously, Vonnie's worked for Monsanto, Syngenta, and with numerous ag and biotech startups. In this episode, you'll hear some of the hard lessons she's learned along the way, what the future of gene editing might look like, and the parallels between the hype around biofuels two decades ago and the hype around soil carbon today. But first, this is how Vonnie came to join the ag and food world.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:So I got my undergraduate degree from New Mexico State University in horticulture, and worked for a little bit in greenhouses and realized that I was never going to pay any bills working in greenhouses. But I did have that early experience of working in indoor ag as a greenhouse. And then I went to UC Davis and got my master's degree in plant pathology. And so that was the beginning of that. And my first job out of graduate school was working with a company called DNA Plant Technologies, which was one of the very early genetically engineering plant companies. It doesn't exist anymore. But that was a really exciting time. I got to be on very early stages of what was happening with genetic engineering and crops and where that could go.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:And so for the next 15 years, I worked in ag biotech in Nashville area, really on the cutting edge of, what is this technology? What can we do with it? How can we grow more sustainably? How can we make better crops? So that was a really exciting time. I worked for DNAP, like I said, and a company called Paradigm Genetics, and worked for Monsanto for a while, and also worked for a company that was buying seed companies all over the world and helping integrate some traits into those.
Sarah Nolet:Vonnie was at Monsanto in the mid-1990s. It was a time when Roundup could be found in garages across suburbia, used commonly as a spray for weeds. But for agriculture, the '90s brought about major leaps in biotech when Monsanto introduced the first Roundup Ready seeds in soybeans, corn, and cotton, using genetic modification. At the time, the science was revolutionary. But no one imagined how much pushback there'd be against GMOs. Vonnie was right in the middle of this and learned a lot about social license.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:Now, when you say you worked for Monsanto, everybody cringes. So that was in the mid-nineties. And I'm sure there were conversations in the board room that are different than this. But for me being there, it was, we had these cool tools. Like we can do these really cool things so that you don't have to spray insecticide and so that you don't have to till, and so that you can do all these other things that are more sustainable. So the conversations internally were like, this is really cool stuff, and this is going to allow us to grow more sustainably. So that was the conversation. And what we completely missed out of arrogance, certainly, was that we needed to bring people along with us in that little journey of that thought process.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:And so, when it wasn't communicated to consumers in a good way, and consumers certainly didn't see any benefit for them in Bt cotton, then that's when a lot of the problems happened. But it's really interesting to think back on. To me, it was quite exciting that the technology could do this and really seeing the missteps that happen from a communication, social license point of view.
Sarah Nolet:Yeah, for sure. Was there ever a moment or a story of consumer pushback, or something happening where you started to realize maybe you got it wrong or that how you guys were thinking about it internally was really different than how the world was seeing it?
Vonnie Estes, PMA:Yeah. Actually, I'll tell you a more recent story that even reflects on me worse. So I was up in Washington State, summer before last, before COVID and we were still traveling. And we were doing grower visits, and we did a dinner with a bunch of apple growers. And I was talking about the Arctic Apple, which is a GMO apple. Right? And non-browning, great sustainability food waste story. I think they've done a pretty good job of communicating to consumers. They don't hide it. They tell people this is GMO. And so, we're at this brewery outside. There's like hops growing in the background, and it was really beautiful.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:And so I started talking about technology, because that's my job. And I started talking about technology, and there's always great technology. Then it's coming to apples, and I start talking about the Arctic Apple. And I just see the room just go dead. Well, it wasn't. It was outside. But I see the group go dead in the eyes like daggers. And I'm like, this is very familiar. Like I remember this, and of all people, I should know not to bring up a topic like that until you really understand how it affects the people in the room and what their feelings were.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:And their main feeling about it was that before Arctic Apple, when they were trading outside the country, like when they're selling their apples, they never had to answer the question, is this GMO? And so that was one of, they said, ""We're getting hit. We're getting the negatives and not the positives about this."" So that was an interesting flash-forward 20 years later, that you really need to pay attention to who you're talking to and how you talk to them about technology and food.
Sarah Nolet:Yeah. My sense is that the industry hasn't fully learned this lesson, because it's not an easy one to learn. That we say now, ""Oh, we need to listen more, and we need to have more conversations and highlight the benefits."" And then we sort of do that. But the response isn't really all that different. And yet at the same time, there's lots of research about how agriculture is really trusted, and we have all this goodwill and people do believe in farmers. So I guess my sense is, I don't know what we do differently. Do you have a good sense of how to do this differently or any hope around what's changing?
Vonnie Estes, PMA:Well I think we've got another opportunity with gene editing, and I've worked in gene editing at a couple of different companies and done a lot of consulting work on gene editing. So one of the big differences is that we can do a lot of good consumer traits with gene editing. And so, if you lead with a trait that consumers want, like if you have better-tasting strawberries or a pit-less cherry or foods that are more convenient, foods that are more nutritious, foods that have a better sustainability story that you communicate correctly, I think consumers are going to come along. And I think it's possible, through COVID and some people getting a better understanding of science and what science can really do to help us, that there's going to be a more openness to what is science doing for our food in a way that's helping me.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:So I'm hopeful. And I think we're trying to do the right things with gene editing of, this really can help with climate change. I mean, so many crops are going to have to be grown in different places or different varieties or grown differently because of climate change. And this is one way that we can do something about that.
Sarah Nolet:What's the conversation like with growers? You're now at PMA, and you'd be talking to companies that are on the production side and marketing side as well. Thinking about how to have these conversations, but also what technologies to invest in and adopt and which ones maybe to wait a little longer and kind of see how it goes. What's the sense from industry around gene editing in particular, but to ag-tech more broadly?
Vonnie Estes, PMA:I think with gene editing, there's a real fear of production breeding and production companies, that they don't want to be first. They don't want to be the ones that the consumer says, ""Oh, you're the biggest blueberry company, and we know that you're using gene editing. We're not going to buy it."" And they don't want the blow-back. And so, I think we're in this really funny state right now, because lots of companies are using gene editing in their breeding programs, but they're keeping it very separate. So hear me, that is not mixing. People are not doing it on the slide. But they're keeping very separate breeding programs just to see what the technology can do, but they're afraid because they don't want the consumer backlash.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:And so, I think there's companies like Pairwise that's in North Carolina, that's doing a lot of breeding in produce. And they're a straight-up firm. Like that's what we are. We're a breeding company. We use gene editing, and we're going to come out with these four crops. And I think companies like that, being out in front and seeing what the benefits are, is going to help. And producers will be willing to grow it if there's pull on the other side. And one of the examples that I use, and other people use this too, is looking at Impossible Foods and the Impossible Burger. So that is GMO soy. And they use a heme protein that's made in a genetically modified yeast. And people can't get enough. Right?
Vonnie Estes, PMA:And they're going to IPO. They're going to really be big. And so, I think if you can be upfront, be transparent with consumers, and give them something they really want, then that's going to bring things forward.
Sarah Nolet:Hmm. How do you think that gene editing will change? Or will it change supply chain dynamics and who owns what part of the industry? Like does ownership change when more companies have access to gene editing or can differentiate in different ways at different parts of the supply chain? Like does it actually shift how traditional lines have been drawn, in terms of who does breeding and then who does growing and who does marketing? Do you see more vertical integration, more fragmentation?
Vonnie Estes, PMA:That's a really interesting question. I think if you look at corn and soy. Now you have big broadacre crops. I mean, you have people that do the science and own the germplasm and sell the seeds. Those crops, I don't think it's going to change. I think it'll be interesting in some of the crops that I work in more in the produce area, because those companies that have the germplasm probably aren't going to invest in the tools and hiring the people to do that work. And I've done some projects with a variety of people trying to look at, okay. Say we want to do gene editing in table grapes. How do we do it? Like how do we even do it? It makes sense to me for it to stay separate and for there to be platform-based companies that do genome mapping and that do the actual edits and that test in the greenhouse.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:And I'm hoping that those companies stay separate from the germplasm companies. Because it just doesn't make sense for, say, a grape producer to make big investments in that type of technology. That should be a separate platform company. And as far as how the value goes, that's what these companies have to look at. Like who captures the value, and where is that value captured? And that's a lot of what these companies that are doing the breeding. They're like, how do I get to capture the value that happens at the Kroger store? Like how do I get that value? And so that is something that I think everyone's trying to work out, is if you're capturing consumer value, how does that go back to the genetics company? And that isn't worked out yet, but I think those are going to be interesting conversations.
Sarah Nolet:These questions, like who pays and what business models will win, are not just playing out with gene editing, but also with all kinds of emerging technologies in food and ag. Soil carbon markets are another very hot example.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:Yeah. I listened to your last podcast that was talking about carbon, which is fabulous, because it's such a hot area. And there are some parallels, I think, in just trying to figure out who owns what and where does the value accrue. I think it's a little different, because right now, that whole breed and all of that is just better set-up. It's more established. And I think with carbon markets, it's the Wild West right now of like, what are we trying to do? And what is the government going to do? And what are the tools we're going to use, and how do we affect this huge system? You can't just have something that measures soil carbon and that's all you have. You have to have this whole system that it's in. And so I think that's the broader thing with carbon that I think is pretty fascinating.
Sarah Nolet:And you've drawn parallels to biofuels, and I'm really curious to hear your thinking there. And I would say probably U.S. listeners are decently familiar with biofuels and what's happened. Maybe international listeners or Australian listeners, less so. So maybe give us a little bit of 101 there and why you see parallels with carbon.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:All right. So when I was talking about my history, so ag-tech ended up consolidating into a very small number of companies. And so, I was off looking for the next thing, because I didn't want to work for another Monsanto and I really wanted to stay in more cutting-edge technology. And so, this was in the early 2000s, like 2004. And everyone was really looking for, we need a different source. We need something besides oil and gas, because the prices were going up so high. And so everyone started looking at biofuels, and first it was corn ethanol, which I was personally less interested in just because there was no great technology leaps we were going to have there.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:And so we started looking at second-generation fuels, is what I ended up working on for 10 years of my career. And that was taking either crop residue or crops that were grown specifically for energy crops, like sorghum and switchgrass, miscanthus. So it's a number of others that were grown to make biofuels. And so, this kind of got going. And this was one of the parallels that I was thinking about with carbon is like, so in 2007, then-President Bush made a comment in the State of the Union Address about switchgrass. And then suddenly switchgrass was a thing, and everyone was working on switchgrass. And the government started putting so much money and said that there was going to be 35 billion gallons of ethanol by 2017 that was going to be made. And half of that was going to be from second-generation fuels.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:So lots of money started pouring in, and people who'd been very quietly studying switchgrass and some of these other things, they were in the limelight. And so much money went into this. So the U.S. government tried to create this market by saying, ""You're going to produce this amount of fuel."" And they put a bunch of money, and they picked companies to put money in. So in 2007, they invested over a billion dollars into developing the technology for this. But they started with the technology at a really high level. They said, ""Build these gigantic plants."" And my job at the time, I was working for DuPont, and I was in charge of a program that we were looking at converting corn stover into fuel. And I had, it was a beaker in a lab. That's where my technology was. It was a beaker fermenting in a lab.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:And people were saying, ""Here's a check for 100 million dollars. Go build a 100 million gallon ethanol plant."" So it was a lot of push without really looking at the system. One, without looking at what technology do we need? What's the state of technology? And what entire system do we need to change for this to work? And then letting the government pick winners and losers. So I think when we look at carbon now, the government's got to be involved, because they set emissions. They set a lot of the standards, so the government's going to be involved. But how do we make sure that we're going after this in the right way and we're not getting too far ahead, putting too much money in when the technology's not ready?
Sarah Nolet:Hmm. And do you see parallels now, with Biden's talk about climate change and a possible carbon bank and the conversations today?
Vonnie Estes, PMA:Yeah. And it's like, ugh. I've lived this before. And so, I'm actually very interested in it, and I'm starting to dig deep into it too, just because it is the next shiny thing. And so I'm really interested and have talked to a number of startups that are thinking about different ways of doing things and how do you measure. And I'm putting together some conversations at PMA about, how do we get the people that are thinking about it, like some of the people you've had on your podcast from Cargill and from General Mills and those people that are having those conversations. How do we talk to produce about that? How does produce get involved in it? And how do they get something out of it? How do they not go down the wrong path? How do they make money, not lose money?
Vonnie Estes, PMA:So, yeah. I think it's a very exciting time, but there's a lot of pitfalls and just, fools rush in. I mean, the amount of money that the government may put in the wrong place. And here in the U.S. when suddenly all of the venture capitalists are trying to string together the carbon buzzwords and fun things. I think we just need to be kind of cautious.
Sarah Nolet:100%. I talked to an investor this week who was saying, ""Wow. You guys are really understanding this carbon stuff. Great to hear it on the podcast. You've made the investment in Nori. We just feel like we don't know enough yet. And we're going to always be behind the curve, because it's moving so fast. And the people that are on the top of the wave are just going to stay on the top of the wave. And so we'll just stay out."" Which I thought was really interesting.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:That is interesting.
Sarah Nolet:There's others who are like all in. And so you're almost already seeing the fragmentation and whether more capital will come in or everyone will go, ah, too confusing. Just see what happens and let it crash. Or actually, this is really big. We need to get involved. So we'll see, I guess.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:Well, I think, at least in the U.S., when the government starts putting money in, then I think that gets investors interested and they'll start pushing along. Because they'll know that that money's there. And so, a lot of what happened with biofuels is there was a company called Range Fuels. I think they got, I don't know, I'm going to get the exact numbers wrong, but it's around 200 million from the government. And then Vinod Khosla came in and put in a whole bunch more money. And so, I think that pushes things along. And so I think in the U.S., with all the people looking at climate change and the DOE world.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:So it kind of mitigates the risks a little bit for investors. So I think we will see investors rushing in. And hopefully we're just smarter about it, because it's a good thing. I mean, we're solving a very important problem. I don't want to make it sound like I think it's the wrong thing to do. It's just cautionary.
Sarah Nolet:Hmm. Yeah. That's kind of what I was going to ask, is how do we balance the sense of potential hype or frothiness with the actual need to have solutions to climate change? Like over a large period, but also ones that enable growers to be profitable and meaningfully participate. Any thinking on how growers can and should be getting involved, especially in produce?
Vonnie Estes, PMA:Yeah. I think that's something I'm exploring right now. Because I certainly don't want to get people involved with, here, buy this. Buy this other new tool, or try this other new thing. And you're already putting the risk and the cost on the grower. And we've talked about this before, that that's not where it belongs. And so, how do we incentivize them in a way that makes them interested and that mitigates the risk from them? And so, I think with carbon sequestration, look at trees. I mean, you look at all the trees that grow produce, and that's a pretty good deal.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:You've got a lot of carbon that's staying there for a long time. And so we should be able to figure out a way that if that's what we're looking to do, is to reward that, then there should be way to do that without them having to bear a lot of costs. So it is something that I'm exploring right now. And I don't know the answer, because the carbon systems that are getting set up through places like Indigo and FBN and some of the commercial carbon systems aren't really looking at the produce industry. And so, I just want to be cautious to not get people into something that then ends up being so much work and so much time, just trying to figure out what tools do I use to measure it and filling out the forms, that it's not worth it.
Sarah Nolet:That's for sure the number one thing we see and hear from growers, is the sense of it's a lot of work for a very uncertain benefit, other than the practices that I can do that improve soil health and create a more productive farm. And all those things obviously make sense. But any of this exploration of other credits or markets feels a bit tenuous right now, especially in produce. Maybe I'll just wait. Where we have seen a difference is when it can be consumer-facing, like wine brands, for example.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:Yeah.
Sarah Nolet:Looking at branding as a carbon neutral winery, or when they actually have that connection to consumers, especially around sustainability. What are you seeing in that space?
Vonnie Estes, PMA:Certainly with consumer-facing brands, where you can tell that story, then there's going to be a real plus there of how to tell that story, and consumers hopefully will pay for it. I'm not seeing, I'm trying to think of anything that I've seen that is specifically pulling through yet. And consumers, I mean, we've found this on everything. You put a bunch of people in a focus group, and you and I would be guilty as well. It's not saying anything negative about anybody. But you'd say, ""Oh, would you pay more for this great brand?"" ""But of course I would!"" But then you put them in front of a shelf, and you look at their basket, and they really won't.
Sarah Nolet:100%. We say this to startups who are testing their market, where it's like the diet question. When you say, ""Would you like to have a six pack and a beach body and all these things?"" Like yes, of course, great. And you give them the celery versus the cheeseburger, and they choose the cheeseburger every time. It's like, what people say they'll do is not actually what they'll do, and that's pretty challenging.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:Yeah. Yeah, definitely. For a while I was working in bio-controls, and it was a consumer brand. And so we had a number of bio-control consumer brands, and we put them in the aisle of the garden stores. And these things, they were before their time. They did not sell. And so we started saying, people want legs up. People want to see bugs' legs up. And so I think it's hard, and we see this in all sorts of ag-tech companies. You see this as well, is that people go and they talk to two or three really forward-thinking producers. And then they think, okay, I can base a business on this. And it doesn't always work out that way.
Sarah Nolet:You mentioned bio-controls. I'm really curious what you're seeing in this space. Is the time now for that? And it's exactly, as you said, a psychology problem with some of these products. Like does it actually work? How do we know? And what are you seeing in terms of solving that psychological problem and just bio-inputs, I guess, more broadly? Has the time come?
Vonnie Estes, PMA:Yeah. I think the time has come, I think for several reasons. One is the reason that you say, is that we're actually able to measure it now, much better than we were 15, 20 years ago. And the products have gotten so much better. They've gotten a lot more specific, and they just work better. And I think also because we're starting to see resistance, and a lot of insecticides and fungicides and some of the bio-controls don't have that resistance. And maybe it's not you can stop using pesticides completely, but you can mix them so that you can use those other chemicals a little bit longer, because they don't build up resistance. So I do think the time is now, and I think it's really exciting.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:Because I beat my head against that one for about five years, and partly, products just weren't good enough. So you have to have a product that works. But I think they are now. And I think just with all we're looking at in the soil and using microbials in soil, and all the things that we can do and test and understand what's happening in the soil, I think it's really positive. That's an exciting area.
Sarah Nolet:Vonnie's also excited for the future of plant breeding, which has always been her first passion since the greenhouse days. But now she sees breeding as a critical tool to help meet some of the big climate challenges we're facing.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:So you're going to have a lot of issues where you're not going to have as much water if it's places that aren't irrigated. Or even if they are irrigated, and you won't have enough water to put on. So I think certainly drought resistance is a big one. I think there's going to be areas that are going to freeze where they didn't freeze, or not freeze where they used to freeze. And so that's why blueberries expanded. Why they did was through genetics, where you could grow them where you couldn't grow before. And that wasn't GMO, that's just genetics. So I think there's a lot of just, the climates are changing, hotter and colder and wetter and drier. And we need to be able to respond to those.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:And breeding is a great way to be able to do that. Storm events, too much water or too much wind, or all sorts of pests that blow in that weren't there before, what kind of resistance can you get? So I think there's a lot. Breeding takes a little longer, but I don't know. Developing a new pesticide takes a long time, too. But breeding is just kind of a better way, if you can do it through breeding.
Sarah Nolet:Yep. And one of the things we've dug into is this changing landscape due to climate change and how these weather events will be more extreme. But also certain things won't be able to be produced in certain areas, or other things will be able to produce there that weren't, but we don't have a supply chain infrastructure. Do you see this combination of new breeding technologies and pressures from climate re-engineering landscapes, like changing what it means to be a farmer? Like are companies going to have to move locations? Will they have stranded assets and have to do something else with them? What's the shift in, again, how the structure of the industry or even what the landscape looks like might be?
Vonnie Estes, PMA:I think that's likely to happen maybe over a longer period of time. But I think one of the things that's happening anyway is that people are starting to think about monoculture and do I really want to just be growing this one crop, and maybe I can grow different crops. And I think that's going to continue to happen, and that's climate change. And just do we need this much corn? This is just my view, but I think that's going to happen slow enough that the supply chain can react to that. It's not going to be like, you're going to have to change this tomorrow.
Sarah Nolet:Right. And how about other countries getting involved in this? Like we've done a little bit of work looking at the Middle East, and obviously Singapore has massive food security goals. Some other countries are looking at, how do we think about food security? How do we think about breeding and using these technologies to grow things here that we maybe couldn't, or now that we have to? Is that a trend you're seeing?
Vonnie Estes, PMA:Well certainly. I've been having conversations in Singapore this week. And so, they import 90% of their food. And especially during COVID, this was a very scary time for them. And so the government has started to pump quite a bit of money into looking at eggs, fish, and vegetables, are the three areas. And they're trying to produce 30% of their food in Singapore by 2030 and putting lots of systems in place. And it's vertical. All they can do is vertical. They can't go out. They have to go up.
Sarah Nolet:Nowhere else to go.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:Yeah. One guy was telling me about, they're doing vertical sheep farming, which I just can't imagine. Some of them are on the 20th floor. But that's certainly happening in Singapore, where they're looking using different technologies. And countries like Brazil are certainly adopting a lot of different technologies and looking at, what else can we grow? How can we grow it? How can we do this better? So it's certainly happening around globally.
Sarah Nolet:Vonnie also predicts a shakeup in some of the traditional food supply chains.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:And so when you look at the whole supply chain, starting from that first mile of leaving the farm gate, getting all the way to retailer or food service in the produce industry, and all that needs to happen there. And I don't know if you've seen it, the landscape map on the supply chain that Seana Day and Brita Rosenheim have done. It's amazing how many different companies are in there. And they really looked at the different verticals, and how do we do supply chain that works? That really goes all the way from the farmer to the retailer and what kind of systems need to be in place. And there's all sorts of systems, computer vision systems, and just the traceability that's important. And so I think that's an area that's really under-invested in and super important.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:And especially, I think, since COVID really exposed how scary that supply chain is, I think people are starting to look at it differently. And I was talking to a company the other day, SWARM Engineering, and it's a bunch of guys from Microsoft. And they're really looking at, how do we do this logistics system all the way through and figure out how to save money and really support the industry? And so I think that's an area, not exactly the area I know the most about, but I think it's a really important area for food to really understand how can we do things there. There's so much going on in the field. And I know you guys work in this area a lot. A lot of the robotics and the automation and artificial intelligence, and then in what's happening in the field.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:And I was talking to a company the other day about this, and I almost had this feeling of, oh yeah, this. And it's so ridiculous that I'm thinking that this is just like old hat. Because it's amazing. It's amazing what they're doing. And I think the adoption on that is going to be slower. I think it may be faster in some ways in produce, because the farms are smaller and the information is more valuable. But it is amazing what's happening. Like being able to know exactly when to pick and knowing exactly which apple flowers to reduce so that you have a better crop. And really using AI to be able to see almost every plant and make a decision on how to treat that. So it's pretty amazing. Yeah.
Sarah Nolet:We're actually seeing that connect to the supply chain, what you made before, where when you have more information about what's happening in the field, what does that mean for how you can re-engineer the supply chain? Do you need as much cold chain infrastructure, or do you need different kinds of logistics support? When you know, basically ahead of time, what you're going to pick or when it's going to be ready or what you're going to do in the field that's going to be highly responsive to what consumers want and on-demand. Does that actually change how supply chains look and work and, to your point before, who creates and captures value? That scenario we're really excited about.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:Yeah. And so when you look at what you just said, that whole piece. I mean, how do you look at interoperability? Like how do you talk to people about that? And that's, I think, one of the biggest issue. It's like you've got 20 dashboards and all those different pieces of data. And so, I guess just all industries go through a process of maturing and that putting together. But have you seen anyone that's trying to crack that?
Sarah Nolet:I mean, we've seen people trying to crack it both from like a, we'll build dashboards and we'll be a kind of Power BI, or whether they're ag-tech specific or not. Kind of aggregate data and give you your view of it, which I think is interesting. Probably hard to get to venture scale, but useful tools that we see growers really, really appreciating right now. There's, I think, a play around some kind of open source approach to creating the standards and helping build the pipes in this space. The challenge is there's a lot of initiatives doing that, OpenAg Data Initiative and different industries. Specific initiatives to say, here's how we talk about vine rows, or here's how we talk about broadacre cropping and what the farm looks like.
Sarah Nolet:It really can be a whole industry approach, but who has the incentive to do that? Who wins? And that's where we are increasingly thinking about open source. How do you harness the momentum of the community to build those tools? But you can still have a venture scale business model, which I think you do need, and world-class tech and software talent, because it really is a tech play. But right now we're in the early stage of industry maturity where everyone's building their own APIs, doing their own work to connect the dots. And that just makes it more confusing. But over time, I think we'll see more standards and more pipes being built. And there are opportunities there for sure.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:Yeah. So do you think that, sorry, I'm interviewing you now.
Sarah Nolet:That's okay. Yeah, yeah. Great.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:So do you think that's five years? Do you think that's eight years? I mean.
Sarah Nolet:Gosh. Yeah. I mean, we haven't seen any companies that are doing that, that we would necessarily bet on. We're starting to see companies recognize that problem and think about how it might be solved. So that's exciting. And if you look at a venture timeframe, then maybe it's five years. Three to seven, ideally, for venture capital. But I would say that's probably the next phase of industry maturity.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:Yeah, that's great. Yeah. It has to happen, and it happens in other industries, but it's hard to get a sight on how long that's going to take and how everybody fits into that.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:That's it for this episode of PMA Takes on Tech. Thanks for allowing us to serve as your guide to the new world of produce and technology.

Vonnie Estes, PMA:Welcome to PMA takes on tech. The podcast that explores the problems, solutions, people and ideas that are shaping the future of the produce industry. I'm your host, Vonnie Estes Vice President of Technology for the Produce Marketing Association. And I've spent years in the AG Tech sector. So I can attest, it's hard to navigate this ever-changing world in developing and adopting new solutions to industry problems. Thanks for joining us and for allowing us to serve as your guide to the new world of produce and technology. My goal of the podcast is to outline a problem in the produce industry and then discuss several possible solutions that can be deployed today.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:Our episode today is powered by Paine Schwartz Partners, a global leader in sustainable food chain investing, Paine Schwartz Partners is a private equity firm with a demonstrated 20 plus year track record of investments across the food and agribusiness value chain. The firm leverages a thesis driven approach and operational expertise to enhance value across its portfolio, please visit www.paintschwartz.com to find out more about the firm and its activities.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:Our conversation today is with Daniel Malechuk, CEO of Kalera. Kalera is an Orlando based vertical farming company. It has high yield automated data-driven hydroponic production facilities designed for rapid rollout. Indeed, Kalera is one of the fastest growing and largest vertical farming companies with two operating facilities in Orlando, one in St. Paul, Minnesota and one in Atlanta. It plans to open five additional large-scale facilities across the U.S by early 2022, including locations in Houston, Denver, Hawaii, Columbus, and Seattle.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:To me, Kalera seemed to have exploded onto the vertical farming scene this past year, but as Daniel explains, the company has been diligently at work for 10 years. In February, Kalera also acquired Vindara, a company that develops seeds specifically designed for use in vertical indoor farm environments. Jade Stinson co-founder and CEO of Vindara also joins the conversation to discuss the importance of breeding for indoor AG. Let's jump into the conversation with Daniel about his background in the food industry and what drew him to Kalera.
Daniel Malechuck, Kalera:Yeah. I spent my entire career in food for nearly two decades now. I have been in various degrees of the food industry across multiple different verticals, whether it be retail, food service, manufacturing and have really enjoyed, always working on something that is powerful, which to me, is feeding people.
Daniel Malechuck, Kalera:And so have worked in again, a lot of different opportunities there, before I had the chance to come to Kalera here and have been with Kalera as their CEO for about two years now. And really before that, about five years ago, three years ago, didn't know what vertical farming was. Wasn't very familiar with it to be totally candid got intrigued when the opportunity came to me and have not slowed down since. Very excited and passionate about waking up every morning, knowing that it gives me a chance to feed people locally, safely, sustainably.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:Great. I have to admit before you purchased Vindara who I was tracking because I like breeding companies and then you also became a member of PMA so thank you for that. I had not heard of the company. I think that's mostly because my personal feed and the information that I get is a bias towards VC backed companies and also West Coast companies, which is a lesson to me to pay more attention.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:So I was so excited when I started reading about the history of the company and how fast you've grown. You're the fastest growing vertical farm company and we'll soon have farms Coast to Coast.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:So please tell us about how the company started and the number of farms you have now?
Daniel Malechuck, Kalera:Yeah. Kalera has been around for a little over 11 years now, and it really started with the science. And as we all know that Science and Technology continues to accelerate, but our two co-founders formed the company originally as part of a project to have a fully self-sustainable city here in Florida. And although that project fell through many years ago, the two founders continued the dream of working on indoor vertical farming. And so that process continued as trial and error and lots of great science that has gone into the company continued to be the focus.
Daniel Malechuck, Kalera:And it was over really the last two years that we've come out from underneath the radar, out of stealth mode and that somewhat coincided with when I joined the company. And very aggressively, we've worked for years to get to the point where we are today, which is to really have a model that's able to be scaled very successfully and fairly quickly and inexpensively again, having industry leading unit economics, to be able to take our facilities coast to coast, as you've mentioned and even beyond.
Daniel Malechuck, Kalera:And that's part of what's been really exciting about the last two years is how quickly we've accelerated and executed. Of course, when I got here, we had already our Marriott HyCube, which is located on the largest Marriott property of the world's property here in Orlando, Florida. And it was really a proof of concept for Kalera to go out of the lab for say, or the research and development segment and right into practice. And it really redefined what pick the plate freshness means for the future there. And so that was an exciting undertaking for the company, but it also gave us the confidence that we would be able to then scale more quickly and much more of a larger scale.
Daniel Malechuck, Kalera:So we opened our Orlando facility, which was here in Orlando, Florida, and we opened that in March of last year. And then beyond, we have now opened our Atlanta facility, which is up and running and we are actually now grand opening our Houston facility this week. And the weeks ahead, we've got our first seeding going into that. So we're really excited that the momentum continues as we continue our expansion.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:And so when you build and open these new farms, are they all exactly the same or are you innovating as you go along? How does that look?
Daniel Malechuck, Kalera:Well, we continually learn. That's a really great question. So no two farms are exactly the same. Every time we go, we tweak, we get better and we continue to improve.
Daniel Malechuck, Kalera:As well as that, not every design is a 100% identical. So we like to think we improve each time we go and we'll continue to develop, but the basis and the baseline is always the same, which is great science that we've worked on for over a decade. A lot of it proprietary and the ability to rapidly roll out very cost-effectively and hyper focused on being farmers first and leveraging the technology when and where and how we can as we come along. But that never changes. We never lose sight of that fact that at the end of the day, what we have to do is provide an incredible quality product, but yet at a very affordable price, because those two things are table stakes for us. We want to have a great product that's affordable.
Daniel Malechuck, Kalera:And so where we take our design, it's generally the same every facility that we go into. It may have some slight adaptations and continual improvement as we go along. So for the most part, they're the same, but there are tweaks for every facility as we advance and as we open new facilities.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:And what are your growth plans going forward? It sounds like you're just moving amazingly fast. Are you going to keep that growth rate up or what's the plan there?
Daniel Malechuck, Kalera:Yeah. Kalera is excited that as you've heard me mentioned already, not only did we open Orlando, but we've got Atlanta that just opened, then we've got Houston, which is opening as we speak. And then beyond that, we've got facilities that we're opening in Denver, Colorado outside of Seattle Washington, St. Paul Minnesota area, as well as Columbus Ohio and Honolulu Hawaii.
Daniel Malechuck, Kalera:So those are all in the works. They're being opened as we speak and construction is underway. But beyond that, we're very excited that there's much more in the pipeline, not only domestically, but Internationally for Kalera here as well.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:Wow. So who do you sell to when you go into an area, say you went into Houston, do you look for local retailers that you sell to there? Or do you sell, do you have Nationwide chains that you sell to and then sell to the local area to those chains? How are you thinking about that? And how does that work?
Daniel Malechuck, Kalera:That's a question that we do spend a lot of time thinking about. And more importantly is really everybody is our customer. But it always starts with quote and quote, the big guys and gals out there that can really help move some volume with you.
Daniel Malechuck, Kalera:But what's so great about Kalera's model is we're balanced well between food service and retail, because we understand that 50% of any given market is really a food service. And so we see that here in central Florida, for example, where we have a really great balance between our customer in the retail segment of Publix. But then of course you go beyond Publix into the restaurant or a hospitality industry. And we have such amazing customers such as Universal Studios, where we do the theme parks here for Universal Studios, and then all the great restaurants we work with Levy Entertainment Group and the Orlando magic here. If you were to go to the Superbowl that the Tampa Bay Buccaneers played in back in February at the stadium here in Tampa Bay, we supplied the product for there.
Daniel Malechuck, Kalera:And so we have a really great mix and a good balance, like I said. So as we expand into new markets, for example, as we move into Houston, Texas. We've got great retail customers lined up there as well. For example, Kroger who is going to be working with us on our product. And so that is a tremendous new customer for us. We're excited, but again, keeping that balance of always being focused on everybody needs our products. And it's not just retailers, specifically, you think about great restaurants and hospitality people and they want fresh, clean, local, safe, sustainable product as well. And so it's a really great balance for us as we expand across the nation and beyond to always keep that in mind that we're focused on both segments.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:I didn't know that. I don't know that any other indoor farming facility or company is, they may be doing that, but I haven't heard them really push that except maybe some of the really small ones that are very local, but that's a really great business model because that is what people want. And that's great that you're really focusing on that. I bet that's been challenging this year, as you're trying to focus and get out into food service with all the challenges and food services this year.
Daniel Malechuck, Kalera:It has but I tell you what it's coming roaring back, which is really exciting. And we've got some really great restaurant customers and even some larger chains that we're working with and have even secured partnerships with. And I'll give a quick example of say, for example, Tavistock group. They are a phenomenal restaurant chain. That's got multiple locations here not only in Orlando, but in Atlanta, for example, one of the finest restaurants in all of Atlanta is called Atlas and The Garden Room. And it is just an, if you haven't been there in Atlanta, it's probably one of the finest restaurants I've ever been to. The service, the food and everything, but they feature our products. And when you come there, it's the finest ingredients and why would you stop at the center of a plate keep going to produce and Kalera has been no exception.
Daniel Malechuck, Kalera:And so it's been really neat to see how chefs really have gravitated towards local and fresh and all of those attributes that our product have. That I think for them, are quite a bit revolutionary. And a lot of times we're selling our product to them alive root ball on product. So when they get it, it's a fresh experience that sometimes they'll even serve. For example, Alfond Inn, here is a very nice hotel in Orlando, which they serve the product with root ball on. They come to the table and we've even heard that they've presented the product to the customer and they twist the root ball off and make it an incredible Caesars Salad for example, right there in front of the customer saying that ""This product was alive until now."" And they serve it to the customer right then. And the customer just is overwhelmed by the crisp nature of the product and how fresh it is. And so equally important to retail is that food service experiences as well.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:That's a great story. Yeah. I think with a lot of these types of products, when you're selling through food service, you really have an opportunity, especially in these more high end restaurants to showcase the product and to tell a story about the product and to give this amazing narrative and background that you don't have on a label because people in retail, people just don't have time. So it is a great opportunity to be able to showcase the product.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:So what do you grow? What are your different products? You said you do some root on, you must do some not root on. So what are the different products and different types of things?
Daniel Malechuck, Kalera:We're very focused on greens right now. And that's micro greens where we have a variety of up to 50 different micro greens that we can do. And this is everything from cilantro to pea shoots, to broccoli to spicy micro mix, et cetera. And we even do something that has a flavor of almost like a sweet popcorn. And we do that for one of our really good customers as well.
Daniel Malechuck, Kalera:And so we have a really great portfolio of micro greens but then we of course do a lot of leafy greens and we do everything from romaine to Kalera crunch, which is an incredible item that sounds like a cracker or a chip when you eat it, it's so crunchy. All the way through to Oak leaves and frisee et cetera. And so we continue to expand our portfolio of the items that we can do in the varieties and how we serve them with and for our customers. And so that is part of the innovation that our team never stops on our product portfolio mix, but we are, again, hyper-focused on greens at this point.
Daniel Malechuck, Kalera:One of the things that's important to me is number one, to do things and to do them very well and just stay focused on what you can do very well in such a large market. We feel that it's something that we want to continue to fine tune and perfect to be the best at not only here regionally, but globally. And so that is... We'll talk a little bit more about our acquisition and how that plays into that part of commitment for excellence, but I'm excited about what the future holds as well as we continue to expand our product offering to our customers.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:So we'll be talking about breeding, as you said in a minute, but what is the technology behind Kalera that makes the company successful? Did you develop it yourselves or with partners? And how did that come about that you're able to grow this great product and do it so quickly?
Daniel Malechuck, Kalera:Well, to be honest, nothing was quick about it. We failed and failed and failed.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:It just looks like that from the outside.
Daniel Malechuck, Kalera:Yeah. And keep in mind, the company's been really focused since 2010. And so it's nearly over a decade now, a labor of love by our team and our scientists. And one of the things that we think we do extraordinarily well is to continually focus on keeping a great quality product affordable. And that's one of our mission statements, or it's one of the key words in our mission statement rather is that affordable, not only fresh and clean and sustainable, but to have the ability to go to the market and to offer a product that is in line with, but yet significantly better for you healthier, cleaner, and sustainable than traditional product. And so we don't want to do it and just have it be elitist or something that only a certain segment of the population has to make a very strong, conscious decision to be able to afford. Not everybody can afford 5, 6, 7, $8 for four or five ounces of greens.
Daniel Malechuck, Kalera:And so instead we've made our product and we've had this focus since day one to be lean, mean and really strategic about how we get high yields. And again, we are very confident that we have industry leading yields and with this and through the ability to leverage our technology, as well as the design process that we've utilized to be able to offer product out there at very competitive pricing, but yet superior in many ways to traditionally farm product. And so that's something that we're very, very excited about, but also very proud of the fact that we, again, continually to fine tune that. But yet we feel that we've essentially perfected mother nature indoors through that combination of science and technology with farming to offer a very great product from a quality standpoint yet at an affordable price.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:Let's switch a little bit to talk about the company. And as I was starting to read about you and learn about you, and then I started reading about some of your newest board members. So to me as someone who hadn't been following the company, and maybe some of the people listening to this, it just felt like you exploded onto the scene with these impressive board members. So tell us a little bit about that process and who you've added?
Daniel Malechuck, Kalera:Well, like all things that Kalera does, we're very deliberate in trying to build the most incredible company that we can both domestically and globally. And that doesn't stop with board members, right? It's not only about the product, but it's about management and building a world-class management team, which we feel that we've done a really great job of, but it continues with the board of directors. And we're very pleased to have assembled a fine board that is going to help us continue to scale and think about our business, not only domestically, but abroad and internationally, and some of the folks that we've been able to assemble on this board. I mean, you look at Sonny Perdue. He was this time last year, the head of all the food for the United States of America, one of the largest food, if not the largest food producing country in the entire world.
Daniel Malechuck, Kalera:And what was so great about adding Sonny to our board is not only, to see him come from a farming family and understands that background, but he's been Governor of great state of Georgia. He served our country at the very highest level as the Head of USDA and the Secretary of Agriculture and his perspective is unparalleled. And to add him to the board and believe me, he's not just a figurehead on the board or a name only. He's here and he's active. In fact, I just chatted with him a little bit earlier, right before this call. And so he's very active in the business and a very, very valuable asset to not only the management team, but to our shareholders as to the company as well.
Daniel Malechuck, Kalera:But then beyond that, you've got great names such as just Kim Lopdrup, who is been a CEO of Red Lobster and help them globally and be very successful. And he's very active and moving to the Chairman of our board position here in the very near future. And then we've got several other big names that we continue to add. Maria Sastre, who has been just in, across multiple boards and throughout multiple different industries, including travel and the cruise lines and was on the board of Publix and is on General Mills's is board.
Daniel Malechuck, Kalera:And keep looking forward. You're going to hear more great things, continue to come on the Kalera board. And we've got several other members, probably for the time of the podcast, you won't go through them all. But it's all very deliberate against to assemble a world-class team, both at the board level and throughout the company. And Kalera is very, very diligent on being very quiet. And then when it came time to really expand and to have our coming out party, that's what I think you've seen over the last 18 months even, or so as we've prepped for this moment, and now we're ready to run and run hard, run fast. And I think we probably caught a lot of people in the industry by surprise, but here we are and we're ready to keep on executing and moving forward.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:Yeah. No question here you are. So you're publicly listed on the Oslo exchange, but I have heard rumblings of the potential of you going public in the U.S. Tell us why and how it would be an advantage to do this? And as much as you legally can about your plans in this area?
Daniel Malechuck, Kalera:Yeah, sure. Kalera is a US-based company. We've got a US-based management team, US-based operations, and our original investors came, this is years ago back in 2013 even when the company was really just getting started and almost eight years ago or so, the U.S was probably not as hyper focused on sustainability in this arena specifically as perhaps Europe was. So our original shareholders came from, at least the bulk of them, from the Nordics and from Europe.
Daniel Malechuck, Kalera:But over time, obviously now we are so blessed to have over 1000 shareholders all around the world on all continents, practically and a lions share them still in Europe, but certainly here in North America and the U.S and Asia and Australia and beyond. And so we are excited to bring the company home and get on a U.S main listing and our targeting. We're working heavily with that. You've seen some press probably about that process and it continuing to go well, as we move forward here, but we've also been very deliberate, just like you saw with the board members that we select. We're very focused on having the best process with the least amount of dilution for our shareholders to absolutely continue to accelerate Kalera's growth, but to bring us back into the U.S and to have access to the U.S capital markets, which have all kinds of advantages for our existing shareholders and for beyond for future shareholders as well.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:Well, let's pivot and talk about breeding one of my favorite subjects. So in February of this year, Kalera acquired Vindara, a company developing seeds specifically for the indoor vertical farm environment. So first let me welcome Jade. Jade Stinson is the President and Co-founder of Vindara. So welcome, Jade. Thanks for being here.
Jade Stinson, Vindara:Thank you. Great to be here.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:Please tell us a little bit about your background and how you came to start the company?
Jade Stinson, Vindara:So up until the past few years, I've spent my time between University and Corporate America. At school, my PhD focus was to work on a project to protect the British potato from quarantine diseases, which really kicked my interest in agriculture. From there, I joined BSF within the Performance Chemicals Division here in the United States, and then relocated to the Research Triangle Area to head up Global Operations for the Professional Specialty Solutions Business within the Agricultural Products Division.
Jade Stinson, Vindara:After 10 years in the company, I decided to join a venture development accelerator as the Chief Science Officer also known as the VP of Will it work. So from there, I sourced and scouted a number of deal flow. I mean, we looked at probably 400 different companies and technologies to really try and find transformational technologies that would ultimately benefit the food system. And it was within the accelerator that we founded Vindara.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:Ah, okay. Yeah. Another way I look at that is how many miracles would it take to make this work? And I always stop at ""If it takes three, it's probably not going to happen."" That's really interesting. So when did you realize there is going to be a need to breed for indoor crops in mind? And what did you do first when you started thinking about that?
Jade Stinson, Vindara:Yeah, after doing diligence in the sector, we learned quickly and we knew straight away that the off the shelf varieties have been bred for very different environments these outdoor or greenhouse environments. And when you think about the phenotypes or the characteristics of the crops, this is a direct result of the genotype and environment interaction. So these highly controlled environments are actually great for predicting the phenotypes of crops. So now we can actually focus on output traits and not the input traits relating to developing varieties around disease and durability.
Jade Stinson, Vindara:So the first thing we did was we went to the market and we asked different players and we needed targets. So we had to develop varieties that would benefit the growers directly as a drop-in solution. We didn't make a decision on the variety or the type or the traits, we listened to the market and that's what we run after.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:And which crops did you start with then?
Jade Stinson, Vindara:So our first crop program is the obvious one, which is lettuce. But if you think about lettuce, it's very segmented and you've got Full heads, Teen leaf, Baby leaf, Cut leaf in terms of the structure. And then you've got the different species. So you've got Romaine, Butterhead, Crisphead, Oak leaf et cetera. So that's where we started. We ran hard after Romaine variety, and then we introduced a Basil program followed by a Spinach program. And right now we have nine active crop programs.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:And what technology do you use that makes this go faster within the company? What makes your ability to breed faster, to get different varieties up quicker?
Jade Stinson, Vindara:Yeah, so we're accelerating the traditional breeding methods. Our speed is what differentiates us. So I'll keep the specifics a little bit confidential, but what I can say is that we leveraged genetic diversity and we're only able to move as fast as we can due to advances in various different types of technology. This predominantly is around genomics and deep machine learning, having the computing power and analytics.
Jade Stinson, Vindara:And so we heavily leverage these to get our products to market unprecedented speed. We'll have commercially available seed at large volumes in September so we've proved out that we can get there in that time. And our ultimate goal is to really democratize the breeding selection process even down to the consumer level.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:Oh, wow. So do you plan on using some of the new molecular breeding technologies like Gene editing as consumers get more comfortable with the technology?
Jade Stinson, Vindara:So what we'll say here is the traits for anything code is Multigenic. So you need to understand these, the computational breeding, which is a part of the data that we gather in our development process. So the same targets can actually be used for Gene editing. So while it's not core to Vindara, we do partner with a University on a CRISPER project on one of our proprietary varietals.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:Oh, that's great to hear. Yeah. It'll be interesting to see this move forward as a good tool when the industry gets comfortable with it.
Jade Stinson, Vindara:Yeah. Absolutely.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:So how opening back up to the conversation here with Daniel. How did Kalera and Vindara meet? Did Kalera realize the power of genetics? Other companies aren't doing this, so how did this come about?
Daniel Malechuck, Kalera:I'd like to say it was something as amazing as that but actually goes back to my undergraduate studies. I went to North Carolina State University and had gotten a call to donate money to the school, which I've done in the past. And any ways they said, ""Hey, have you heard of this company, Vindara, they're a startup coming out of NC State and they're working in this arena and maybe you should connect with them and have a call."" So it actually was a result of Dr. Stinson was coming out of an NC State incubator. And so we got connected that way over a year ago now. And I think so it gave us the opportunity to connect with Jade in an early stage. And our team started very quickly working with her and testing the seeds that she had generated and going through that.
Daniel Malechuck, Kalera:And so the conversations continued over the course of several months and our teams got together and we were seeing great results from the seeds that Vindara had developed. And so it just became more and more important for us to secure up the supply chain of what we think is one of the most critical steps to having incredible product, which is the seed obviously. And so if you could find a way to increase yield and shorten, grow time by having seeds that are specifically tailored for indoor farming, and you could secure that, then we moved very quickly. Once we realized the power of how incredible what Vindara had to offer was.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:Yeah, that's great. I think a lot of people don't realize the power of genetics, especially in an environment like yours, where you can control so many other things. And so what's left to control is the genetics to really work the best that it can in that environment. So why did you decide to acquire the company instead of partner?
Daniel Malechuck, Kalera:Well knowing how quickly Kalera is growing and going to continue to grow for the future. Seeds, number one, they're a significant expense as part of your cost to goods sold, but number two, to have that ability to guarantee that supply chain, to continue to develop and Kalera is always committed to being the leader in this space. And that's no exception when it comes to having the only company in the world that does what Vindara does. And I think it became clear that this could be a very strong play for Kalera to continue to focus on growing great plants and continuing to have the ability to have that affordable function of our plants remain present for us as we go forward.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:And for you Jade, why did you decide to be acquired instead of Partnering?
Jade Stinson, Vindara:I think we have a shared vision on, we want everyone to have access to affordable food. And we really loved that about Kalera. We saw their great growth strategy and we were really pleased to partner with them.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:So what trait, you talked a little bit Jade about what traits you are focusing on, but can you talk a little bit more about how soon the consumer will notice a difference with new improved traits and what traits you're looking at for the future?
Jade Stinson, Vindara:I think initially it's agronomic. Right? It's getting to improving these unit economics, which everyone always points to in the sector. So how can we make great seeds and actually great economics for the growers? We focused a little bit on texture and color, but I think the next iteration, now we've kind of got our tuned in, pedigrees, I'll say is really around dialing in the nutrient and the flavor profiles, which at that point you'll see a direct impact to the consumer.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:It is interesting to hear the focus Kalera and Vindara have on breeding for indoor environments. Outdoor plants are bred for qualities necessary for outdoor environments, such as drought, flood and insect resistance, traits not needed in indoor growing. Breeders for indoor AG are focusing on traits such as rapid growth, performance in low light environments and manipulation of plant stature. In addition, novel crops can be bred for flavor and nutrient density.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:Germplasm developments have the potential to expose consumers to a variety of different products with additional desirable traits. Kalera's fast paced growth and dual focus on food service and retail. We'll get these products in front of consumers quickly.

The development of agricultural biologicals - biostimulants, biopesticides and biofertilizers - is growing as global agriculture looks to move towards more sustainable ways to boost yields and new methods of crop protection. Growers are increasingly looking to agricultural inputs based on microbes to both reduce and complement the use of synthetic pesticides and fertilizers in their fields. Biological controls have been around for years, but represent only 10% of fungicide and sales and have not yet made a dent in nutritional inputs and skepticism still remains.

Vonnie Estes, PMA:Today's topic is biologicals. This is a recorded webinar focusing on biologicals and their viability as an alternative to conventional inputs. What you will hear is one of the most candid conversations I've been a part of on the promise and current status of biologicals as pest control and biofertility. Our guests are experts in the field. We are joined by James Pearce, Chief Scientific Officer from Boost Biomes, Karsten Temme, CEO of Pivot Bio and Brynne Stanton, Head of Strategic Innovation at Joyn Bio. We will jump into the conversation with James Pierce of Boost Biomes describing his company and their products.
James Pearce, Boost Biomes:We are a startup microbials discovery company based in south San Francisco and we have 16 employees. And so what do I mean by a microbials discovery company? Well, we discover and deliver live microbes to serve as crop inputs. And that can be the full spectrum from row crops to a specialty crops, such as fruit and vegetables. And indeed it's a specialty crops that are our primary focus. Within that, we're focused on bio control. So these are live microbes that prevent the infection of the fruit and vegetables by pests, bacteria and fungal disease causing agents. And those of you on the webinar can see one of our microbes in action here delaying gray mold on raspberries. And so, some of you may know there are many biological companies out there selling microbes and other biological inputs for agriculture, indeed two excellent examples are with me on this panel. What makes Boost Biomes different?
James Pearce, Boost Biomes:Well, if I use bio-control as an example to explain this, traditionally we've thought of bowel control in a binary sense, and that you have a pathogen in the soil or the roots or the leaves, then you have a plant and the pathogen causes disease on the plant. And then you introduce a microbial inoculant, which inhibits the pathogen and the pathogen goes away, and the disease goes away. Well, if only it were that simple, these two species do not exist in a vacuum. There are millions of other bacteria in these environments, in the soil and the roots, and fungi, and collectively we call that the microbiome. And this is a term that you will have no doubt heard in other spheres beyond agriculture. And within that microbial community, that microbiome, there's a pretty much infinite number of conversations going on between bacteria and fungi, and some positive conversations.
James Pearce, Boost Biomes:There are synergistic relationships between microbes that help each other's growth and there are antagonistic microbes that actively inhibit each other, and collectively these interactions we call the interactome. And what makes Boosts Biomes discovery platform unique is that we take into consideration these interruptions when we discover and deploy microbes. And what does that look like in the lab? Well, I haven't got time to go into the details, but please follow up with me afterwards, if you would like to. We basically recapitulate that interactome in the lab. And in doing so, we can identify and isolate synergistic pairs or sometimes consortia of several microbes that are synergistic, they support each other's growth. And we believe, and this is sort of the premise of our technology, that if you subsequently deploy those consortia back into the environment in which they came, they're more likely to be persistent and robust and therefore active when faced with the many biotic and abiotic stresses that they come up against in the environment.
James Pearce, Boost Biomes:Think of it as sort of going out into the world, supported by a sycophantic entourage of friends. You're more likely to survive with that group than a loan. And then subsequently you can screen that consortia for any activity you're interested in that relates to crop health. And as I say, our primary focus is on bio control. And I think this premise of robustness and persistence and consistent performance, which has been a bane of microbials over the years, and I'm sure we'll talk about that later. I think because our microbes have proved to have such broad applicability across a wide variety of environments, I think it is testament to this hypothesis. We can control pests in the field, we can control pests in the packing house, along the washing and spraying lines, and we can control pathogens in the clamshell all the way up to the supermarket.
James Pearce, Boost Biomes:We can control fungal pests, bacterial pests, nematodes, and interestingly, we have products that get inside the crops where some pathogens lock, for example, classically Panama disease of banana we've shown we can get inside the fruit and control that disease which is a major breakthrough. Also a testament for synergistic microbes is the fact that all our microbes seem to play nice together in the fermentation tank. So although we have multiple microbes, we can co-ferment them, which is obviously has a cost of good implication. And also because they're robust and persistent, they seem to do well on the shelf and we have two year shelf life products.
James Pearce, Boost Biomes:So that's all I have time for. I'm afraid a brief introduction, please reach out to me, this email address jap@boostbiomes.com. I'll be happy to answer any questions and getting into any discussions if you'd like to partner with us. And now I'm looking forward to hearing from Karsten and Brynne and getting into discussions. And I'll be defending the corner of the wild type native microbes against the engineer cousins from across the bay.
Brynne Stanton, Joyn Bio:My name is Brynne, and I am the Head of Strategic Innovation here at Joyn Bio. Today I'll talk to you a little bit about Joyn, our mission and how we're engineering next generation biologicals. And throughout the course of the next few slides, I'll very quickly tell you a little bit more about what that means. So I still consider myself in fact, to being new to the ag space. I've been with Joyn for about four years now. And given that the microbial complexity and content of soil still truly amazes me. For instance, it's estimated that a single teaspoon of soil contains billions of microbes. Now over time, microbes and plants have evolved to exist in a mutually beneficial relationship with respect to one another. In this relationship, plants provide microbes with food in the form of carbon. And in exchange for that food, microbes provide plants with essential nutrients. These nutrients are so important to crops that they go out of their way to cultivate and maintain their microbiome as evidenced by the fact that they release up to one-third of their photosynthate into the soil.
Brynne Stanton, Joyn Bio:At Joyn we're looking to harness this long withstanding naturally occurring relationship that takes place between plants and microbes, but to take this even one step further by engineering our microbes to provide even greater benefits to our target crops. I'll walk you through at a very high level quickly, just what we mean or what this process entails of engineering microbes. So on this side, I've likened the process to the plant biotech model, which is likely familiar to many of you. In this model, you take a beneficial trait and leverage biotechnology to insert that trait into a crop. The resulting crop then produces that beneficial trait whereby it confers protection to the crop.
Brynne Stanton, Joyn Bio:At Joyn, we've replaced the crop with a soil microbes. So specifically what we're doing is using biotechnology to insert this beneficial traits into a highly characterized soil microbe that we've confirmed to be highly associated with our crops of interests. It's that resulting combination of the soil microbes with the beneficial trait that constitutes the engineered microbe. We then apply that engineered microbe to our crop of interest at which point that engineered microbe then confers that benefit to the crop. And so we really think about this as the microbe or the engineered microbe as the vehicle that's then delivering these traits to the target crop. We refer to what we're doing at Joyn as engineering better microbes for agriculture, because we're able to go in and really increase the levels of the active ingredient or the beneficial traits, or also provide access or exposure to that beneficial trait over a longer period of time. And so what you get by combining those two things is more consistency with our engineered microbes for agriculture.
Brynne Stanton, Joyn Bio:So if you haven't heard about Joyn, we are in fact, a joint venture between Gingko Bioworks and Bayer Crop Science. Even though we are a joint venture, we are wholly independent from our parent companies. We're also a bi-coastal company. So we have a presence, both in Boston and in Woodland, California. In Boston, we are located approximately to Gingko's high-throughput organism engineering foundry. So that's where the bulk of the microbial engineering work takes place. And then conversely, in Woodland, we're located within a Bayer facility. So of course that's where the majority of our implanted work takes place.
Brynne Stanton, Joyn Bio:Having the parent companies we have provides us with sort of the best of both worlds. So through Gingko, we're able to have access to sort of breeding edge synthetic biology tools, and through Bayer, we have a lot of exposure to considerable commercial ag expertise, as well as expertise in the field of ag biologicals.
Brynne Stanton, Joyn Bio:And then the last thing to mention is that we've been around since 2017 and the company started at that time, with an a round of over $100 million. Before I hand it over to Karsten, the last thing I want to share with you is the four key areas where we are applying or looking to apply our technology. So our technology is focused right now, mainly on crop protection and sustainability, but we could also envision using our technology in areas of crop quality, and we'll talk about that a little later during the Q & A, as well as crop efficiency. We are right now, most active in the areas across the top row. So in crop protection and sustainability, and it's our bio fertility use case that falls under this umbrella of sustainability, which I'm sure we'll talk about a little later today.
Brynne Stanton, Joyn Bio:And then the last thing to mention is that we are primarily focused or only right now focused on row crops. So we're taking these areas and applying them to row crops, and that would be mainly corn and soy. And so that sort of a whirlwind intro to Joyn Bio. And with that, I will stop sharing and I am looking forward to sharing additional details throughout the Q & A.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:Thanks, Brynne, let's turn it over to Karsten.
Karsten Temme, Pivot Bio:Hi. So my name is Karsten Temme, one of the co-founders at Pivot Bio, and I'll start by sharing a bit about the cause that motivates my team, that drives us. And that's, I probably shared with many of the folks on our webinar and podcast. And that's, we want to see every farm out there be a lot more profitable and have the kind of economics and business sustainability. That means there's longevity, that operation gets passed down to the next generation. And then ultimately, the ripple effect is that we've got a more resilient agricultural system than we have today, better for the health of the soil on that operation, better for the broad environment around us. And just ultimately, the connection between us all gets a little bit shorter.
Karsten Temme, Pivot Bio:And the passion I have, the passion my team has is to contribute towards that cause through the fuel that powers the nutrients every crop needs, and that's rethinking what it means to use fertilizer and maybe coming up with a little bit better way to produce the nitrogen crops need and deliver it directly to the crop in a way that doesn't have some of the side effects that using fertilizer has had across the last century.
Karsten Temme, Pivot Bio:And our focus, like Brynne mentioned, at Pivot, we are focused on the broad acre row crops, and really rethinking fertilizer for the main cereal grains of the world. It turns out that about half of our nitrogen fertilizer is used on corn, wheat and rice. So the impact we want to have is to make that better for a grower. So most of the growers in the US who are in the Midwest planting a corn, soybean rotation, the dilemma they face is on average, about half of the fertilizer that gets applied every year doesn't actually end up in the crop. It's not the fuel that allows the crop to have sufficient nutrients to build the DNA, the protein, and ultimately the grain that drives their economics. And so that nitrogen is lost to the environment. It's either turning into nitrous oxide as a greenhouse gas or it's running off to pollute our waterways.
Karsten Temme, Pivot Bio:And the challenge is that fundamentally moving big, bulky tons of fertilizer around is just inefficient. It's hard to apply it to a field at the time when the crop needs it, and we're forced to bank inorganic nitrogen in the soil. It's like the wrong place to store nitrogen. So the more we can remove inorganic nitrogen from the equation, the more we can produce it on demand for the crop, it has benefits for the economics of that operation, it has benefits for the sustainability of our environment, and ultimately, it's going to lead to a more stable agricultural system.
Karsten Temme, Pivot Bio:So what Pivot has done is go back to nature for inspiration. All of the legumes of the world have symbiosis with microbes that live in their roots breathe in the nitrogen gas from the atmosphere and turn it into ammonia, a form the plant can use. And that symbiosis, it actually exists for all the plants on this planet. It's just not as sophisticated, it's not as evolved as legumes for the crops like the cereals. So what happens is that symbiosis is a looser relationship between the soil microbes and the plant. And when we as humans invented fertilizer, 120 ish years ago, we disrupted that symbiosis. We forced those microbes essentially into hibernation. And the key enzymes that carry out that process of turning nitrogen gas in the atmosphere into ammonia, those have been dormant inside of the genome of these microbes.
Karsten Temme, Pivot Bio:So what Pivot does is we rediscover those microbes. We reawaken those genes, the enzyme that's critical to that process. And we package that up into a product that's easy to use. So it simplifies the work on the farm. It shrinks the entire Haber-Bosch fertilizer factory into something that is living and breathing and working on a daily basis to spoonfeed the plant its nutrients, and ultimately it's packing all of that nitrogen that's produced into the plant instead of storing it in an inorganic nitrogen form in the soil to be lost to the environment.
Karsten Temme, Pivot Bio:So Pivot has spent the last decade developing that breakthrough and bringing it into the marketplace. We've also built a business model that connects us directly with growers. So we sell our product to our customers through independent dealers across the US today. We've been serving our customers for three years now across millions of acres in the US. And we really see it as just the beginning of something different, something that brings us a bit closer to our customer, and ultimately through the benefits to the farm, a bit closer to all of us as consumers on a global stage. So what we've started is something that our aspiration is to grow to be a global company that serves farmers across the world. Primarily is going to be focused on the major cereal grains, and then partner with other types of companies to be able to bring products in the market for different types of crops. And our goal is to be a a partner across agriculture for decades and decades to come.
Karsten Temme, Pivot Bio:So I'm really looking forward to today's conversation around biologicals, happy to talk on nitrogen to any degree folks want, and really jazzed up about the conversation.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:Great. Thanks. All right. If everyone can turn their cameras and mics back on and we can start our discussion. So hopefully that was helpful for all the listeners to hear about the companies and their products and how they're approaching biologicals and give it a little background. So thanks for that. So as all the speakers mentioned, there are benefits for using biologicals. There's a lot of benefits over some of the traditional inputs. So the big question of today is, are biologicals a viable alternative to conventional inputs and pest control and fertilizer? They've been around for years, but represent only 10% of fungicide sales and are not making a huge dent yet in nutritional input. And skepticism still remains among a lot of growers. So why is this, and how are your products different and how are you doing this differently that's going to make an impact. James, why don't we start with you?
James Pearce, Boost Biomes:Yeah. I think in general, inconsistent performance, as I mentioned, shelf life, traditionally they haven't last a very long on the shelf and there can be compatibility issues. So you might have to ask to grower to adopt a separate practice. I think it's an unfair, it's not a level playing field either. I don't think the agricultural industry or the food chain has been asked to pay the true price of chemistry. And so when you have a more sustainable solution, you're up against something that's cheaper in terms of money out of pocket, but from an environmental perspective is a lot more there. And therefore, I think fixing that will go a long way towards doing this. And I think outside of the bio-control space, there is no requirement to demonstrate efficacy. So you can sell something on Amazon tomorrow with no data. And that has led to a lot of snake oil out there and that has solid the reputations of decent products that I think are produced by at least the three of us. And we all suffer for it.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:Brynne.
Brynne Stanton, Joyn Bio:Yeah, sure. We would love to build upon that. So I think it's important to keep in mind the intended use of biologicals and the goal. And I think the goal has always been for biologicals to allow for a reduction in the use of conventional products, but not serve as an all out replacement. So I think it's really important to keep in mind the specific context for under which their use is recommended.
Brynne Stanton, Joyn Bio:So, first and foremost, I think you hear a lot of people mentioned that biological should be used as part of an integrated pest management program. So one input of many to control pets, and then taking that one step further. I think a lot of cases where you've biologicals to be quite effective are typically in spaces where they're controlling low to moderate disease pressure. So I think it's really important to keep these things in mind when you start talking about their efficacy. And I think once you start to get outside of this space of low disease pressure or using in combination with a whole suite of products, then you start to see some of that inconsistency and the bad rap that biologicals have come to be known for over the years creep in.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:Karsten, do you have anything to add to that?
Karsten Temme, Pivot Bio:Maybe I'll take a little bit different approach and that's put on my hat as an entrepreneur and say, why do I see a customer's eyes light up in some cases, but not others. And I think it comes down to better. And for a long time, I don't think biologicals have been better or able to deliver something that an incumbent product can deliver. And the real power of a new innovation to captivate a customer's excitement is because it can do something that nothing else before has been able to do. And I think that's now possible because of so many new dimensions of science or technology that are coming together in a bunch of companies and beyond just the three representative today. And so, we think about product design at Pivot as being able to get at the Achilles' heel of the thing we're trying to disrupt. All the things that classic inorganic chemical fertilizers can't deliver today, that's really the thing that if we can design a product to solve, it translates to happy customers and a growing use of our product.
Karsten Temme, Pivot Bio:Similarly, I've been inspired by the team at Provivi and what they're trying to do to scale up the use of pheromones as a bio control mechanism. And really being able to have a different way of looking at what it means to be precise and accurate, something that really hasn't been possible at the same scale with maybe the classic uses of chemistry.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:So kind of keeping with you, and really what customers want and what makes them happy. So nitrogen is pretty cheap and it's pretty effective. So what is the incentive to change? And do you see legislation is going to force the issue for that?
Karsten Temme, Pivot Bio:I think that innovation is best when it stands on its own outside of legislation. And for us, while fertilizer may seem cheap because it's a commodity, it's still often either the biggest or the second largest expense on broad acre row crop operations. And the challenge is much bigger than just the cost. It's the unpredictability of the performance of that product. Everything's transacted today in terms of the number of pounds and dollars you spend to apply that nitrogen to the field, and nobody holds the fertilizer companies to account for how much of that fertilizer actually ends up in the crop, how much nitrogen is there to fuel the harvest, and that's the equation that we're trying to solve. So when you buy nitrogen from us, it all ends up in the crop.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:Go ahead, James.
James Pearce, Boost Biomes:Sorry, I'm going fly the flag for Pivot. I think one of the major issues with nitrogen is that generally speaking, you added all of the beginning of the season when the crop doesn't actually need as much. And it's actually later on in the season and the Pivot microbe would still be there and it's impossible to get more nitrogen while it's hard to get nitrogen to the crop mid season. So I think then an appeal of the Pivot technology is getting nitrogen to the crop throughout the season. If you need to add me to your sales team Karsten just say.
Karsten Temme, Pivot Bio:I think that my parting shot is always, I love to be able to find everybody who has a like-mind towards the bigger goal, and we'll take you on the team any day and we'll load your praises throughout as well. So thanks.
Brynne Stanton, Joyn Bio:James has got tied a side gig. I love it. So I did want to add, so there are years when nitrogen is cheaper, but I think one of the things that doesn't go away is that it's not in fact cheap for the environment. It's quite taxing on the environment to be continually producing at an industrial scale, the levels that we're producing. So I think one of the biggest incentives to change is what you would get as a concomitant reduction in both the production of greenhouse gas, but also our reliance on fossil fuel. So if we're even able to reduce just a teeny bit the amount of nitrogen fertilizer that's industrially produced that we're providing to our farm lands, this should go a long way in just leaving the environment in a much better state.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:Well, I think, of course, all of us listening agree with this, but I just wonder if it's unproven technology in the grower's mind and they're maybe having to pay more, or it looks to them like they have to pay more, or just changing practices can be costly, the time involved to change your practice and to try a new product and worry whether it's going to work or not. We're all kind of thinking, okay, in a world of full cost accounting, when we're really looking at what's happening to the planet, of course, this makes sense, but when you're out there, Karsten, when you're talking to customers, are they willing to take this leap and say, okay, I'll try this even though I know nitrogen works well enough and I've been doing it forever? How do you make that sale?
Karsten Temme, Pivot Bio:I'll try to frame my answer so it's maybe then applicable to some of the other types of applications for biologicals. One of the things I think that's possible today more than ever in the past for biologicals is we can all talk about the mechanism of action, get into the details on why something works and why this new innovation or product can deliver exactly the benefit we all claim. And that is a great spot to be in.
Karsten Temme, Pivot Bio:One benefit, I think for Pivot is Agronomy 101. Every farmer has talked about nitrogen fixation for 100 plus years. It's not a technical subject that we need to educate customers about, it's something that's near and dear to everybody that we interact with. And so for us, it's really just delivering the proof that we have broken through on what's been this elusive holy grail. And once we can demonstrate that proof for each customer, the flood gates open, the use of the product across all their acres follows very rapidly because it's a reduction in the amount of work required to manage new nitrogen. It's an added piece of mind. It's all these other things about just the equation of nitrogen becomes easier. And I think that is really what we see is driving the flywheel for us.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:Biologicals for the most part are better for the environment, decreased nitrogen runoff, improve soils and result, and fewer chemical applications. However, because many of the microbes used are genetically engineered, they cannot be part of an organic farm. Here the panel has discuss what this means to their companies and the products.
Brynne Stanton, Joyn Bio:I think organic farming specifies that your agricultural products have to be produced in a very specific way. And one of those specifications is that these products can not be produced with any engineered components. And so by definition, right now, Joyn microbes cannot be used in a process for something that's destined to be organic. They just don't qualify today.
James Pearce, Boost Biomes:Yeah, that's one advantage that we have. We are all organic wild type made of microbes. We haven't mentioned it. That said, it's still very hard. When we ferment and formulate our microbes in order to be organic, all the ingredients we have to use have to fall under a list called OMRI. Don't ask me all the acronyms down. So I would guess the O is organic and the I is ingredients and you can make the other two up, but basically that's very restrictive and inexpensive. And I feel for Brynne and Karsten because ultimately, engineered sygenics, gene editing, you can call it what you will, what's frustrating, at least for me is, the people that control what the consumer understand as organic, basically the NGOs who basically make the rules as to what is and isn't organic, no matter all of our best intentions. And so we can talk about EPA regulations until we're blue in the face, but ultimately if you can't get non-GMO project on your label, then you're kind of screwed, no matter how hard we try at our end.
Karsten Temme, Pivot Bio:Thinking about kind of the problems to solve in organic, the challenge with organic today is so many of the inorganic fertilizers used in broad acre conventional farming can't be applied into that organic system. So there's really a shortage of routes to get nutrients into that field. And so what we've done at Pivot, the way we structure our company is we want to be able to push the boundary of knowledge available to all of us. We want to be able to bring those innovations to market as fast as possible. And today, we've put a constraint on our science test to say, we want to avoid making products that are transgenic, that would fall under, I think what the public has perceived as GMO today. And the way it's constrained our product design is it means, in some places we dig into our toolbox, we use things like gene editing. Those are products that won't qualify for inorganic label. And then we've got products in the pipeline that are built with more classic methodologies that do qualify.
Karsten Temme, Pivot Bio:And I think the goal is ultimately to say that the big challenge is we don't have as many tools for nutrients in inorganic operation as you do in conventional. So we just have to really get to the heart of what's the allowable set of tools and then apply those to microbes, which are the wonderful vehicle for doing things that you just can't in any other way. So I think the conversation maybe over time could be, how do we better meet those long-term goals for sustainability or performance, and does that toolbox of what's allowable expander or not?
James Pearce, Boost Biomes:A question I would have for Brynne and Karsten is, given the majority of your product is consumed by chickens and cows, is organic less of an issue for you than it would be for Boosts who are basically selling products that gets sprayed onto raspberries, strawberries, et cetera. Is that an ignorant statement?
Brynne Stanton, Joyn Bio:No, I don't think so at all. As I mentioned, we're focused on row crops where for the most part engineering is widely accepted tool for row crops in the United States.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:So this is a question I was going to ask later, but for Karsten and Brynne, do you see applicability to the produce industry? I know what your focus is right now, and I understand why, but do you see, as you move forward that you would bring products into the produce industry in fruits and vegetables?
Brynne Stanton, Joyn Bio:I think the technology itself lends itself quite well to fruit and veg. I think the challenge is one that we've already hit on, which is this issue of public perception and sort of meeting a pretty drastic shift there, where people are open to biotechnology and engineering for food. I can look to pharma where biotechnology and engineering is perfectly acceptable. So the question is how can we sort of shift a little bit more towards pharma and deal with some of the stigma associated with engineering when it comes to food? And if we can make progress and headway there, I can think of a bunch of different avenues, like shishito peppers, where they have just the right level of heat. So you're not playing Russian roulette every single time you eat one or something of that nature. You can think of a bunch of different ways to leverage engineering for nutrition or quality or taste.
Brynne Stanton, Joyn Bio:So I think absolutely, Vonnie, but we would need to see some shifts in the perception. And I think that really just starts with hopefully who's benefiting, why this is beneficial and just talking much more publicly about it.
James Pearce, Boost Biomes:Can I jump in? So those consumer-based traits are obviously attractive, but how would a microbe effectively impact those? You've got Pairwise leading the way on genetics for taste and nutrition and flavor. It's a harder task for a microbe to do that indirectly, wouldn't you say?
Brynne Stanton, Joyn Bio:Well, I think for us colonization is key. So it just depends on where in the microbe that, oh, sorry, where in the plant that microbe is colonizing, where it's localizing within a particular plant. And so if you're getting into the right environment then, or within the right compartment within the plant, then you could start to impact some of these qualities. But yes, I see on principle how that might be a little more challenging to grasp.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:So the microbe, in that case, you would have some kind of microbe that would colonize the plant that, would it actually change the genetics of the plant or how would it have that kind of effect? This is very cool.
Brynne Stanton, Joyn Bio:Sure. So I think there's a bunch of different ways that you could do this, but microbes themselves wouldn't be changing the DNA of the plants, but they would be inhabiting parts of the plant and producing molecules that give you an interesting flavor profile or something of that nature. That would be one way to do it. You could also sort of spray them on where they're then producing these interesting flavor profile molecules on the surface of the plant. So there's a bunch of different ways to look at this and could be really exciting. But again, I think whenever you start talking about food and engineering, there's a lot of concern that comes along for the ride.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:Right. Now, I think those of us in produce in this area are really working at communicating with consumers and making sure we bring the consumer along, but there are so many exciting tools and ways to get at how do we adapt to climate change and how do we work with nutrition and flavor in these areas. So we can add microbes as some of the possible tools. That would be great.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:So I have another question. Could the three speakers speak to persistence in the field or on the shelf. And then specifically for James and the same question, how does the infinite number of molecular conversations that they characterize in the lab shift over time, both in the field and on the shelf?
James Pearce, Boost Biomes:Okay. I'll take the first one. I didn't seed this question I promise, but basically that's the beat of our, that's our premise because microbes deployed are as consortia. They are self-supporting synergistic consortia, and therefore, we've got evidence to show they persist longer. Okay. Not in the field, that's a very long, hard experiment, but in terms of colonization on roots, et cetera. And how the interactions change over time, they will, that's really all I can say. We know the microbiome of a cone roots store relief, whatever it is, changes over the course of the season, because the plant is giving out different exudates, both on the surface and on the roots. And that will affect the microbiome, which in turn will affect who's talking to who.
James Pearce, Boost Biomes:All I can say is that we know our microbes persist as an endophyte inside the plant for up to 45 days. What happens after that, I don't know. And frankly, once the food has been harvested, we don't really care. If we can get the fruit off the field without any fungal disease or if we can delay the onset of those horrible furry strawberries you find at the bottom of your clamshell, then our job here is done and we can move. That's really all we can claim to achieve in the moment.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:Karsten or Brynne, any comments on persistence in the field?
Brynne Stanton, Joyn Bio:Yeah, I can touch on that quickly. I think for us, all of our microbes that we're working with have been bioprospected from the field, are existing naturally already in close association with our crops of interest. As far as persistent studies, from a regulatory perspective, we are required to do those studies or we're asked to do those studies. And so we're conducting them right now. Joyn is still a relatively new company, but we've got, I think our second year of field trials. No, in fact, third under our belt. So persistence is still exploring that and can share more later.
Brynne Stanton, Joyn Bio:In terms of shelf stability, this for us is really key. And that's why this decision of the microbial canvas that you start with is so critical because we really want to be starting with microbes that are shelf stable for a number of years, that can then just seamlessly fit into a grower's process.
James Pearce, Boost Biomes:I think it's an interesting answer. So how you regard persistence is a good thing or a bad thing depends on what it is you're putting out there. A regulatory person would say, that's a GMO microbe. I don't want it to persist. Whereas I take the question of, well, this is a wild type microbes that came from the field. So we want it to persist, and that's what makes out good. We're not motivated to try and get, we don't want a microbes to go away. It's naturally part of the environment. So the longer it's out there doing its thing, the better. It's an interesting take on whether you think persistence is good or bad.
Karsten Temme, Pivot Bio:Well, and I'll add on a layer to say for us, it's all through the lens of performance. The microbes we work with are part of that native microbiome with any of the crops that form our product portfolio. They start in small numbers when the seed is planted, they grow, they multiply, they flourish as the root system is developed and more of the photosynthetic has exuded the sugars to feed them. But once the crop is harvested, they die off. And I think that natural life cycle, the symbiosis with the plant is perfect in the way we design our product, because it means that we have the most number of microbes available to produce nitrogen for the crop at just the time the crop needs the most nitrogen.
Karsten Temme, Pivot Bio:And to James's point earlier about the challenge with using inorganic nitrogen as a fertilizer is, they're in the field at the wrong time and the microbiome is able to produce at just the right time. And so, I think persistence maybe is just the first layer of thinking about microbes can be present or absent at different densities. They can change that relationship with the crop throughout a growing season and that can be a very powerful design tool in tackling some of the problems we all face.
Karsten Temme, Pivot Bio:And so for Pivot, I think we've done a lot to build a model around those broad acre row crops, the cereals, and the technology is applicable into produce. The challenge is they are going to be slightly different. And that's where I think we need as much by way of partners for go-to-market, as we do for really fine tuning what the microbes can do on a day-to-day basis for the crop that gets at the limitations of using inorganic fertilizers today.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:One of the questions I wanted to ask is... So another thing that's been talked about a lot recently is around carbon neutral foods, carbon sequestration, and carbon credits. Do any of you see how biologicals could capture some of this value that's being thrown out and talked about in carbon farming?
James Pearce, Boost Biomes:This is a hot one for me. Technically, yes, microbes can suddenly be a big part of the carbon farming world, but commercially, there is just not currently a powerful word. All the carbon credit systems at the moment are based on models, and those models are built only on practices that have been ongoing for at least 10 years. And that basically leaves you with cover crops and no tail. So if you had a microbe that you said, well, I put all this organic matter in the soil because I've got bigger roots, great, but you're going to be taking carbon measurements for the next 10 years before anyone's going to give you a carbon credit.
James Pearce, Boost Biomes:I also think that putting organic carbon into the soil is a very short-term fix because what happens to organic carbon, it gets respired and therefore releases CO2 into the ground. I think a much more intelligent play would be to mineralize carbon and microbes can certainly do that. I also think it's very tough at $15 a ton of carbon, I think to try and persuade a grower to change their agronomic practice at that price. I'm told it's just not viable. It needs to be in the $50 to $60. And so do we need tax incentives to get people to do that?
James Pearce, Boost Biomes:And I'll be interested to know what my two nitrogen replacing friends on the panel will think about this. There's currently no nitrogen trading system or any, in fact, any model that will give you a credit for inputs. So, even for Boost, were replacing chemistry with a biological, there is an input to play there that is relevant to the greenhouse gases and yet there is no way of capturing that. I'm told they are developing models that will allow for other inputs and other practices, but right now anything you see on a website claiming X bucks an acre for carbon credit is really noise right now.
Brynne Stanton, Joyn Bio:I appreciate the practical response to that question, James. I wanted to tackle it from the microbial side of things. So microbes actually are really good at naturally pulling carbon down into the soil where it can be stored for hundreds and in some cases, thousands of years. And so if we're able to pull more carbon into the soil, we'll eventually end up with a more fertile soil. And so I think from the microbes perspective, if we can enhance the microbes ability to do this through engineering, that this could be something that could really, I would say at the end of the day result in more nutritious soil. So just from the microbial perspective alone, I think this is something that is achievable, and I don't think it would have to be far outside of a grower's regime if you could come up with something where that microbe was simply part of the seed package.
Karsten Temme, Pivot Bio:Yeah, I'd agree. I think it's an exciting time. James, you highlighted just the challenge. Nobody's been able to link these things together to date and there's many, many folks interested in working on the space. So maybe we'll see some breakthroughs over the coming years. At the end of the day, EPS footprint is driven by nitrous oxide emissions and methane emissions from livestock. And then we have this potential to sequester carbon if we can figure the permanence challenge out.
Karsten Temme, Pivot Bio:Really the nitrous oxide, the more we can reduce inorganic nitrogen in the soil, the bigger impact we have there. And for the first time we now have a new class of products, not just from Pivot, but I potentially Joyn and many others that are all going to contribute to changing those inorganic nitrogen levels in the soil. And the science tells us that permanence for carbon sequestration is ultimately linked to inorganic nitrogen levels as well. So there's a lot of potential. We still need these business mechanisms to allow record-keeping, measurement, verification, being able to link those into the markets, but it's at the early days of something that could be really powerful. And some of those opportunities are going to have immediate impacts, and some of those are going to depend on solving that challenge of permanence.

Vonnie Estes, PMA:Welcome to PMA Takes On Tech. The podcast that explores the problems, solutions, people, and ideas that are shaping the future of the produce industry. I'm your host, Vonnie Estes, vice president of technology for the Produce Marketing Association and I've spent years in the Ag-tech sector. So I can attest, it's hard to navigate this ever-changing world in developing and adopting new solutions to industry problems. Thanks for joining us and for allowing us to serve as your guide to the new world of produce and technology. My goal of the podcast is to outline a problem in the produce industry and then discuss several possible solutions that can be deployed today.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:This week's podcast is being sponsored by Paine Schwartz Partners, a global leader in sustainable food chain investing. Paine Schwartz Partners is a private equity firm with a demonstrated 20-plus-year track record of investments across the food and agribusiness value chain. The firm leverages a thesis-driven approach and operational expertise to enhance value across its portfolio, please visit www.paineschwartz.com to find out more about the firm and its activities.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:Today we talk with Paul Lightfoot. Paul is the founder and current president of BrightFarms, a hydroponic leafy greens producer in the US with five farms in 2,500 retail stores. I talk to Paul about his journey with BrightFarms over the last 10 years and the strengths he sees with indoor growing around supply chain and water. Paul has also started a newsletter called Negative Food and is on a mission to look at how we can grow food and create brands based on regenerative farming practices that draw carbon from the atmosphere.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:Paul believes if we eat food that draws down carbon on a net basis, our food system will be a lever to reverse climate change. He believes consumers can make this happen by choosing foods with negative carbon footprints market forces will guide farmers and food companies toward regenerative practices. Paul is optimistic that the next five years will bring a wave of carbon-negative foods to the market. And by feeding ourselves with such foods will make the world a better place and save it for future generations. We cover climate change, carbon-negative foods, a challenge to organic crop systems and oysters.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:Great to talk to you, Paul, there are a number of topics that I want to discuss with you today. Let's start with the great success of BrightFarms and then move into other topics you are speaking about frequently these days, like carbon. Most of our listeners know BrightFarms, It's a hydroponic leafy greens company in the US. You are in over 2,500 stores, which is pretty amazing. I just read that recently and maybe it's gone up, but that's a great number and you have four soon-to-be-five farms. So you were the founder of BrightFarms over 10 years ago. What was your vision when you started BrightFarms?
Paul Lightfoot:Yeah. Well, I love the question because it's fun to think about that. The idea for BrightFarms was one that I effectively made up from scratch, but it was based on identifying a problem in the marketplace that I thought could be solved. And that's the answer to your question, right? The vision was to go after a supply chain and the incumbent salad supply chain, which is all based out on the West Coast, I thought was vulnerable to disruption. It was vulnerable largely in terms of having a product that was made worse by its supply chain. But I also thought that industry was going to face some headwinds with respect to water, food safety, vulnerability to weather as is the climate change.
Paul Lightfoot:And so the vision was to really replace a long and complex supply chain that caused problems, sort of suboptimal outcomes for the product and replace that long and complex supply chain with one that was short and simple in a way that was better for the product and would be better for consumers and for customers. It was that simple and then that vision, I'd say it has largely been realized, as you probably know we're not the only player in the space anymore.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:No.
Paul Lightfoot:We do have more than 2,500 stores and we actually have five farms that are open. So we're even a little ahead of the data that you're looking at, but there's been billions that have flown into the space just over the last two or three years. And every major food retailer in the US has a local indoor program or is working feverously to get one. So then they're not behind anymore. And I would say that it's a really big category. I don't mean the indoor part, the whole thing, but the indoor, local slice of it is still very small.
Paul Lightfoot:It's probably less than $150 million, but it's really where all the growth is and BrightFarms is the leader in this niche. So we feel like the thesis has been validated by the response in the marketplace. We feel like the growth is amazing right now, but we feel like there's just a ton of work to be done. So there's so much market share to be captured over the next several years that we've got our blinders on executing as fast as we can.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:That's amazing. And people weren't talking about this 10 years ago, all this, all the disruption, and especially since we've seen, in the last year or so, people weren't thinking about, ""Oh, we're not going to have enough water."" or ""Oh, what if there's a supply disruption?"" So it's pretty amazing that, I mean, you were, obviously, but I don't think consumers were thinking that way.
Paul Lightfoot:And, you know I didn't make this up on a whim. I did a lot of research, right. I sort of developed an analytical thesis. People were talking about the problems. I mean, you can go back 10 years ago in California had plenty of people talking about the water problems as an example. It wasn't being talked about in a system-wide way, in a way that it would impact the category. And of course, that's where the opportunity for a company like BrightFarms was born, right. Thinking about problems in an innovative way is often how you get innovation. But to agree with you strongly when I brought the idea home to my wife, who's still my wife. She said, ""No, I don't approve that."" Well, I mean, we overcame that, not without... I spent some political capital on it. There was a lot of people saying, ""What the hell are you talking about?""
Vonnie Estes, PMA:Yeah. No, it's really true. So how do you see the rise of indoor salads and how the indoor salad industry will win in the long run?
Paul Lightfoot:Well, the rise is it's again because of the product, right and it generally is, right. You need to have several factors, but if you don't have a product, that's a better experience for the customers in this case, retailers or consumers, it's not going to work. So the easiest way to think about it is that the local indoor salads are five to seven days fresher than the long-distance field salads. And it's a two-week category. So a week fresher is just an enormous amount of difference. That's why there's this rise and the improvement of the product can be seen in certain metrics that are amazingly powerful in almost all retailers that we've gotten into their category sales have risen materially, right. So, same amount of shelf space, but the dollar sales of packaged salads goes up when we enter the category, right.
Paul Lightfoot:And for a retailer, that's catnip, right. That's really where the action is because they want to increase their sales without increasing their costs or cutting out of the products. So I think that's going to continue in the long run and really over the long run it's the idea of sustainability that will be the reason that indoor salads eventually goes the same way that indoor tomatoes went, right. And if any of your listeners don't know if you go back 25 or 30 years ago, just about every fresh supermarket tomato was grown in the field somewhere, often in places like California and Florida. And today, the vast majority of supermarket fresh tomatoes are grown indoors, we have every reason to see the same thing is happening now with salads and a large part of that will be because of the product, of course, but it's also just to be sustainability in general.
Paul Lightfoot:And I don't mean sustainability like big companies talk about their strategies. I literally mean the definition of sustainability is can something continue indefinitely. And if your business model is based on the aquifers beneath Salinas Valley, it's the definition of not sustainable, right. Every year, more water is taken out than is recharged through snow melt or rain, or any of the ways. And they're digging deeper wells, the ground is subsiding in some cases, the salt water is intruding into the aquifers. If our government doesn't regulate that, if our commercial markets don't regulate that mother nature surely will cause in the long run sustainability is not a choice. It's going to be imposed on us. And this is one of the first places on earth that we're seeing it imposed right now, we're watching.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:So do you think then, right now it looks like to me is the category is getting bigger, but do you think as there's more indoor, that there's going to be less outdoor because of some of these limitations you're talking about?
Paul Lightfoot:Well, it's above my pay grade, the answer to that question. I mean, I actually think that humans should eat a lot of salads. So I think the whole category should grow. I do think almost all the growth is coming from indoor to local right now, whether that means that the field-grown stuff will decline. It's actually a very complex question to answer. And I meant that literally it's not something that I'm smart enough or have enough information to answer because a lot of it is like labor base, right? Will people continue to grow in fields, things that require migrant labor in a period in history where you can't get that kind of labor, where other products could be grown in a way that's more mechanized, right. It's easier to automate. I don't know, I don't know how that's going to play out.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:Yeah. And I think with water, I'm in California and the last couple of weeks, that's all anybody's talking about is we're just going into this huge drought and what is that going to do? Even this year for crops, there's going to be a lot of crops not planted because there's just not going to be water. And the change in our water, we're now going to start getting more of our water from rain and not from snow melt. And we're not really set up to handle that and so I think there's some infrastructure issues as well that's going to cause some of the shift. So what did we learn from COVID that supports the growth and continued success of CEA?
Paul Lightfoot:Well, I think two main topics, the first is that people's health was a great predictor of whether or not they were vulnerable to severe illness, and by health, I mean in the sense that even before COVID, chronic diseases related to diet are the leading cause of death United States, right. And sadly, these are avoidable deaths, right. We don't need to have chronic diseases related to our diet. That's a relatively modern invention if I could use that word for something so tragic. And what we learned is that people that were subject to chronic diseases related to diet, like the diabetes and obesity, would dramatically more vulnerable to severe illness and fatalities of COVID. So that's the first thing we learned, right. People should replace the sugar-sweetened and ultra-processed foods that Americans eat with fresh fruits and vegetables.
Paul Lightfoot:And there'll be less vulnerable to the next experience we have that's like COVID, if God forbid we have another one. And the second one, which I think is probably more what you meant when asked the question, is that we learned that having long and complex supply chains doesn't serve us well in times of volatility and disruption, right. And before I started BrightFarms, I ran a company that automated the distribution centers of retailers. And in many ways, the job was very efficiently getting goods made in the far east to consumers in America and by efficiently, I mean at low cost, right. And when I started, that has about 30 years old, I did it for almost 10 years. I felt great about efficiency. I like efficiency as a thing on its own, but over time I started feeling less excited about a global, hyper-efficient supply chain.
Paul Lightfoot:And that's why you see me thinking about local supply chains. And then all those feelings became intensified during the pandemic, where you saw that a global problem like COVID prevented materials and people from moving around the earth efficiently. We're still, of course, suffering with chip manufacturing shortages, there's not enough cars because of chips and things like that. I do think that we're realizing as a society, that you want to have enough slack in your supply chains, that when there's disruptions, you won't have people go without things that they need, like chips, like food, not the chips that are food, but semi-conductors or whatever. In particular, having a decentralized system of intense food production facilities like what BrightFarms does, I do think is in the interest of society. And I feel proud to be working on that during this period.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:Yeah. So lastly, since this is a tech podcast, what technology advancement has helped make BrightFarms successful, and what areas or new technology do you need more of?
Paul Lightfoot:Well, I'll start from early, to now, to future in the answer. The first thing for us was controlling the climate, right. And I think people sort of gloss over that, but it's important and it's not that easy to do. So we have high-tech, computer-controlled greenhouse facilities that deliver the experience to the plants that they need to survive and to thrive. And that's where it starts and we can't ever lose sight of that, right. Especially as the climate changes, whereas we operate in more places with different climates, that continues to have to evolve. But the second is things like camera scanning and machine learning and artificial intelligence, we've got a proprietary platform that we call BrightOS that really pulls all the data from thousands of sensors in lots of different systems.
Paul Lightfoot:And not just in the environment for growing plants, it's also the noise that comes from our supply chain that comes from the demand from our retailer partners. And it synthesizes it all together in a way where we can operate as resource-efficiently and as cost-efficiently as possible in a way to make us a more effective company. We're a company that has always made it clear to ourselves that we're not growing fancy food for fancy people on the coast. We want to grow mainstream premium salads that Americans can afford. We're selling at Walmart and Ahold Delhaize, not just at your neighborhood inner city, fancy specialty food retailer. And so we want to be able to operate as cost-effective, as soon as we can. And I do think by the way that the data shows we are the most cost-competitive of the indoor salad producers.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:Yeah.
Paul Lightfoot:So that's sort of now, by the way, but as I think about what's in the future, it's definitely automation. We find ourselves already highly automated and I should say at BrightFarms and we grow the way we do, which is horizontally, largely because it enables the high degree of automation without $100 million robots, right. Growing vertically hasn't really figured that out yet. They're either spending a lot on labor or they're doing insane amounts of almost primary science to automate something that's not easy to automate, but we find ourselves now, I founded BrightFarms in 2011, we find ourselves now in a much more challenging labor environment than I think I had ever imagined.
Paul Lightfoot:And it didn't just start because Trump had bad immigration policies. It started well before that it was exacerbated in the Trump administration. And now it's gotten much worse because of COVID. It would be naive to think that it will revert next year to what it was seven years ago. So we're prepared for a really long haul where labor is difficult to come by and we're making massive investments in automation right now in areas that we didn't necessarily know we were going to try to automate so that we can overcome those challenges and continue to be showing up on shelves for our retailers and doing it with high quality and the surety of supply.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:So let's shift gears a little bit here and talk about some of the things that you've been talking about and you've been making a lot of noise lately. I love it with some different thinking through your newsletter called Negative Foods and articles. I've read about you and speaking that you've done. And one of the things, that, a quote in your newsletter was, ""I have a voice and a platform to encourage and support and shine a spotlight on startups bringing carbon-negative foods to market and so I'm exercising that voice and leveraging that platform."" So how did you get here and why is this important to you and how is this an evolution of where you are in your career and your life and your beliefs?
Paul Lightfoot:Yeah, it probably seems less abrupt to me than it does. And I say that because I didn't start BrightFarms just because I needed to find a new way to get paid, right. I had a pretty good career before this, but I wanted to be in the sustainable food industry and that was because my personal passion was there, right. I spent my 30s feeding myself and my family in a very progressive way and my career felt a little bit old school, right. And I started thinking to myself, I wish my career was in this area, that I had this personal passion. And so when I started BrightFarms, I think before I hired a single person, I knew what our mission was going to be, which was to improve the health of Americans and the health of the planet.
Paul Lightfoot:And so I think BrightFarms has that baked into its DNA because that's what I had baked into my DNA. And I'm proud that BrightFarms still flies that flag without me holding the flag very often. And in many ways, that's what this next part is about as well, right. So it doesn't feel that abrupt to me because it's an evolution of the same sort of principles. And then as I thought about celebrating food brands that had supply chains that reversed climate change, I actually think about what I've done, right. BrightFarms at its heart is a company with an innovative sustainable supply chain that is a start-up branded food company, right. And that turns out to be a somewhat unique set of experiences, and I guess I should say skills as well of skills, is something that you've done and you can help other people with.
Paul Lightfoot:And so when I started thinking about how will the food industry change? And this is something I thought about for several years before I started talking about it out loud, it was clear to me that foods with regenerative agricultural practices that are carbon negative or carbon neutral footprints were going to be a part of the solution for how society reverse climate change. And I just realized that my experiences would be more relevant to it than most because BrightFarms had a more sustainable, innovative supply chain change, BrightFarms was a branded food company that went to market through retail. And so I just decided I would shine a spotlight on people early in their careers, perhaps building startups that had supply chains that would help reverse climate change with regenerative practices. And it felt pretty natural to me to think about it like that.
Paul Lightfoot:Now, of course, the other piece of this is that climate change went from being something that environmentalists talked about 10 years ago, but the President didn't, right. And world leaders around the world did not to the degree they do now. And more important than anything, there are no longer large, thoughtful companies that aren't talking about it and talking about it as being an important priority and not just operating companies, but the world's biggest investors, the endowments, sovereign wealth funds, family offices, and foundations. It's very hard to find any now that doesn't feel like these sort of ESG principles are at the heart of their success in the future and not just because of their values, but because they believed that not being long on reversing climate change is going to be a bad financial strategy. And so the rise of all of that sentiment in the world, particularly the commercial world, helped me recognize that this was the right time for something like this.
Paul Lightfoot:Although I'll admit that it's the right time when I think about how the investors think about it and often, how the entrepreneurs think about it. It's very early for how consumers think about it. A lot of consumers still don't really understand what regenerative agriculture is, and they don't necessarily understand how their food choices are going to make climate change better or worse. Although I would argue that food choices are about the only set of choices individuals can make that make a difference right now because you're not easily changing the carbon footprint of steel, and glass, and concrete. You're easily changing the footprint of transportation and energy. That has to be done in a more systemic or government basis. But your food choices could make a difference and almost right away.
Paul Lightfoot:And I should also say that food is unique in that it can be a lever to make the climate worse or better, but it's also unique in that we always make choices about it all the time. You can reduce your airplane travel. You can turn down the thermostat in your house in the winter in the Northeast, but you're probably still going to have to eat the same amount of meals next week as you did eight years.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:Yeah. So talk a little bit about what it means for food brands to have a carbon-negative footprint, and maybe give us some examples of some that you've highlighted. What does that mean?
Paul Lightfoot:Oh, sure. So this is a topic I think, you know I get excited about and it's inherently exciting. So carbon negative literally means you sequester more carbon than you admit, right. You draw down from the atmosphere more carbon or carbon equivalents than you released in the atmosphere. And so what that means is that if you find foods that have carbon-negative footprints when you eat those foods, the atmosphere has a little bit less carbon in it than when you started and there's some terrific examples that I'd love to give. Here's an example of a category that people maybe don't think about that often, but it seems as if oysters are a product that pull carbon from the atmosphere when they're growing and when you eat the meat of the oyster, the animal protein of the oyster, a lot of that carbon remains in the shell and it's essentially permanently sequestered.
Paul Lightfoot:It can go into building materials, you can throw it back into the ocean essentially becomes a shell that'll a long time. And if we had as many oysters, New York Harbor, I think had half of the world's oysters, when Henry Hudson sailed up the Hudson in 1609, we've harvested a billion oysters around New York City since then. And now there's only a tiny slice of what was once there if we brought back the number of oysters, which, by the way, makes the water cleaner, provides jobs, there's almost nothing bad about that. It doesn't require feeding there's no feed that goes into it. There's no fresh water that's consumed. You're actually just going to end up with less carbon in the atmosphere than you had before. And if you think about what else could be like that, right?
Paul Lightfoot:You know, you could grow wheat in a regenerative fashion. And I won't try to define what regenerative agriculture on this call is, but some of the practices include refraining from tilling the soil, using cover crops all year round. When possible, using fertilizer from animals instead of from chemical processes like the Haber-Bosch system. And there's a handful of those practices as well. But when it's done in a thoughtful way, and it's rotated in a thoughtful plan, it has been proven by lots of research and by practical applications that crops like corn, soy, and wheat can be grown in a way that sequesters more carbon soil than is released by the lifecycle of the product. And then you could find yourself choosing regenerative bread brands where you're eating bread that is regenerative. There is a Scotland based beer company called BrewDog that uses solar for a lot of its energy.
Paul Lightfoot:It built a giant forest and its facility. And right now, because of that forest, it's drawing twice the carbon from the atmosphere, then it releases in its manufacturing process. So every beer that you drink, Vonnie, from BrewDog, is sequestering a little bit of carbon. So if you really care about climate change, they'll drink as many of those tonight as you can. And I've probably talked about belCampo meats on the West Coast. We're not far from you near Mount Shasta, they raised their cows in a way that it's pastured on land that's used in a way that it's also regenerative, right. So I'm going to probably feed my kids hamburgers tonight that's from that farm. And again, it's a little bit better for the carbon atmosphere than before it existed.
Paul Lightfoot:I'm probably the only one in this newsletter that's making a list of these things for people and the newsletter is relatively new, but a couple of years into it maybe the newsletter will have an index of like here's products you should think about shopping if you want to be part of the lever to reverse climate change. And what I really hope is that consumers will start to recognize that they need to be choosing foods based on the carbon footprints and when that happens, I think you're going to see a virtuous cycle of more consumer demand that begets more and more products that have these footprints.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:So this ties into two questions I had. One is around scalability, and a lot of these brands are great local businesses, and we love them. We love to have them. We love to support them. Can they scale to a level that is going to make a difference around carbon? And then secondly, where is the consumer and how do we bring the consumer into this conversation so that these brands and some of the bigger brands can actually do these practices and make a difference?
Paul Lightfoot:Yeah. So and I do like to make a point that I'm a capitalist, right? I'm a staunch environmentalist, but I'm not a socialist and I'm not someone that thinks that we need to shut down the food economy to save ourselves. I actually, and I wrote a newsletter about big food that suggested that big food is a big part of the problem, but they might be part of the solution and that upset some people, right. That think that the small holder producers are the future and I don't have anything that's small to producers and I have lots of them in my pantry right now. But if we're going to, for example, replace all the trucks from food distributors, it's going to be easier to do it with the four giant food distributors.
Paul Lightfoot:And it is going to be by starting a million regional food distributors that won't have the same access to capital, that may not have consistent sustainability initiatives. So I think that business models that scale, scale. Business smells that don't scale, don't scale. I'm going to be trying my best to identify the ones that do and to celebrate them. I'd actually give you that oyster example. I think that there's a massive market opportunity for oysters around the world. It doesn't take up land. It doesn't pollute anything. It makes the water cleaner, perhaps kelp it's similar. If we could replace some of the soy and processed foods with kelp-based nutrients that's similar to oysters and the way that it grows very little input, it's better for the environment, pretty cost-effective to produce and there's been an enormous amount of research.
Paul Lightfoot:I would suggest looking at the Rodale Institute or the IPCC report that suggests that a lot of the row crops that are grown in a way that's bad for carbon can be grown in a way that's good for carbon at enormous scale, and the NRCS, the division of the USDA that teaches farmers how to operate well has been teaching this for a long time for decades. It's not some new concept for the NRCS or for the USDA. It's getting farms to adopt it's what's going to be important. Really importantly, we haven't talked about farmers in this conversation and my newsletter is not celebrating farmers. It's celebrating brands, but the brands aren't going to be worth much if they don't have good farmers that are able to succeed. There is a lot of data that suggests that yields would go down when they leave behind their current practices and move to regenerative practices, but that their costs will go down even more.
Paul Lightfoot:So you'll see less yield, but you'll see higher farm income. And that will be welcomed by farmers, particularly younger farmers. And we need the younger farmers in this country, right? We're sort of aging out or farmers. A lot of today's farms feel like they're on a treadmill of higher yields and lower-income and that turns out not to be sustainable either. And again, I believe that sustainability has a way of imposing itself on systems. So I think that a lot of farms are getting it now that moving to regenerative practices for those sorts of crops is quite doable at scale and when they do it, the yields will go down and their incomes will improve.
Paul Lightfoot:And I don't want to leave this concept out here that we're going to grow this food, and we're going to starve, right. I made the joke about my business model is based on feeding 10 million people. I also feel like when I hear people say, ""We don't have enough food to feed the people."" I think that's just so obviously not the case, right. You know, 40% of food is wasted right now.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:I asked Paul to talk about his view on organic food and how organics connect and don't connect with regenerative Ag.
Paul Lightfoot:I'll start by saying that the idea of organic is a great one, right.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:Yeah.
Paul Lightfoot:And my family eats a ton of organic food. So I'll start by saying, I don't want to be a hypocrite. I don't want my kids to hear this and comment online that I'm a liar since our pantry and our refrigerator is full of organic food. So my actions are clear that I do support organic. At the same time, and I'll say this directly, the organic movement has failed to achieve its goals, right. If I think back to what we were trying to get done when this country adopted the organic standard, it was to reduce the use of pesticides. It was to make food healthier. It was to make the environment better when it comes to the agriculture system and we just simply haven't done those things, right.
Paul Lightfoot:First of all, look at the fact that only 1% of US farmland is organic, right. It's not even material, it's completely de minimis in terms of the impact it's having on US farmland. I think something like 6% of our food is organic, right. So we're importing all of that, maybe it's doing good for the places that we're importing it from, which would be fine. It's just not doing it on a material basis in a way that's changing the American farm system. So, but I would also argue that pesticide use has skyrocketed in the last 10 years, right. I thought we were supposed to get less pesticide use. And then finally, and I will say that I don't think this was well understood, when the USDA adopted the organic standard in 1990, I don't think it was well understood that being organic didn't mean being good for carbon emissions.
Paul Lightfoot:And there's just lots of cases now with food being grown that meets the organic standards but isn't doing much for carbon emissions. And in fact, maybe it's a bad actor for carbon emissions. There are regenerative, organic standards out there. They're not adopted by anybody yet, they're not official, I don't think. That sounds like a great idea to me, right. Have both but for now, yeah, I think organic has proven to not meet its goals and it's a shame and if consumers think that, Hey, I'm doing everything I can, I'm eating organic. Like, I'm playing my part here. It's not my fault that we have climate change. They shouldn't feel that way, right. They're going to have to make more choices than just eating organic.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:Yeah, I agree with you. I mean, the organic movement started in a really great place with great goals, but I think times have changed. It's like a lot of these rules that were put together decades ago. And I think really looking at incorporating different practices and having slightly different goals and measuring those goals makes a lot of sense. If what people think they're doing is buying more nutrient-dense food, that is better for the planet to grow. That is more sustainable. That's better for the soil that needs to be looked at and re-evaluated.
Paul Lightfoot:Yeah, absolutely. And I don't think we're likely to see that just because it's organically grown, it's got better nutrient density than we used to have in this country. And this is maybe too much down the rabbit hole, but nutrient density of food is really highly correlated with the carbon footprint of food, right. Or I should say, the lack of carbon footprint of food, right. When you have the biodiversity in the soil, when you've got that microbiome of the soil, it's because there's biodiversity and carbon matter in the soil. That means it's got generally storing carbon. It's good for the carbon footprint of the food, but it also leads to a lot more nutrition in the soil, but it's early days for that. I barely understand that, maybe I don't even understand it that well. I don't think most consumers even would know what we're starting to talk about here.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:So you-
Paul Lightfoot:Wait, but I do think, actually, I'm not pessimistic about the role of consumers here, right. I want to talk about what I think is going to happen, right. I know that consumers care about climate change right now. That's not up for debate, there's been an endless amount of research that's made that clear recently, of both parties in this country and people all over the world. What people don't know is the carbon footprint of their food, but they're starting to ask it. And lots of food companies are starting talking about it, including big food companies, which again I think shows the positive role some big food companies could have in this and I think that consumers are going to pay more for and choose foods with carbon neutral and carbon-negative footprints.
Paul Lightfoot:And I say that knowing that there's been a lot of market research that says that consumers won't pay more for food, that's better for the environment. So a lot of marketing experts say, ""You're being naive, Paul, in thinking that people will pay more for green products because research has shown that they won't."" But I disagree when I look at the organic movement, which, as I said, I don't think has made the planet that much better and I don't think it's proven to be healthier. People are buying more organic food, it captures more and more market share and they pay a huge price premium less than it used to be, but it's still huge. They're doing it because they perceive it to be, whether it is not, they perceive it to be better for the health and better for the environment.
Paul Lightfoot:And that's more important to me than research data that's actual market data, right. So once we can show consumers that food with carbon-neutral and carbon-negative footprint is both better for the health, which it will be because there's more biodiversity in the soil and that it's better for the environment. And it's actually better in lots of ways. It's better for water, it's better for runoff, but particular, it's better for the climate, which is every young person's number one priority right now. People will choose it over foods that don't have carbon-negative or carbon-neutral footprint. And that's going to cause an enormous flight in consumer demand to foods with carbon-negative and carbon-neutral footprints. And that's going to create, I think, one of the greatest entrepreneurial opportunities of our lifetimes, you're going to see food startups that grow fast and achieve success in ways that we probably haven't seen, in my opinion, since the.com boom of the late 90s.
Paul Lightfoot:And even though it corrected itself, the internet industry didn't go away, as we know, right. And it's going to cause an enormous amount of capital flow in from growth, private equity metric capital firms. And I think a lot of them are going to make a lot of money and good for them. I hope they do. It'll create a virtuous cycle where we see more and more businesses that do these things. And the big food companies will either see the writing on the wall and they'll create their own carbon-negative food brands and I hope they do. And if they don't, they'll acquire the startups and that's fine, too. They'll reward the entrepreneurs and the investors for taking the chances to compete with them.

This episode focuses on the success story of fruit production in Chile. The public and private sectors have worked together to expand production of fruit using all types of technology and innovation. In 2019, the fruit-growing sector in Chile achieved record exports, of over $6.5 B US dollars with an increase of 3.6% compared to 2018. This is a reflection of Chile's strategy of expanding into new markets which has led to a significant increase in the number of export destinations, up from 78 markets in 2003 to 129 in 2019. Hear about the work being done in both sectors. And enjoy your winter blueberries.

Vonnie Estes:Welcome to PMA Takes on Tech. The podcast that explores the problems, solutions, people and ideas that are shaping the future of the produce industry. I'm your host, Vonnie Estes, Vice President of Technology for the Produce Marketing Association, and I've spent years in the ag-tech sector. So I can attest, it's hard to navigate this ever-changing world in developing and adopting new solutions to industry problems. Thanks for joining us and for allowing us to serve as your guide to the new world of produce and technology. My goal of the podcast is to outline a problem in the produce industry, and then discuss several possible solutions that can be deployed today.

Their proprietary in-house grape genesis program converges agronomy with flavor, creating value for growers, differentiations for retailers, and taste for consumers. Please visit www.snfl-group.eu for more information. SNFL, delivering science, technology and innovation in partnership with nature.
We are especially happy to have SNFL sponsor this episode, because of their strong presence and support in Chile in table grapes.
This episode is focused on Chile, the largest fruit exporter in South America, responsible for 60% of all fruit exports. Chile is the leading exporter of fresh blueberries, grapes, plums, dried apples and prunes. It is also the second largest exporter of avocados, cherries, walnuts and raspberries. Grape is the leading fruit, followed by apples and blueberries.
In 2019, the fruit growing sector in Chile achieved record exports or over $6.5 billion USD, with an increase of 3.6% compared to 2018. This is a reflection of Chile's strategy of expanding into new markets, which has led to a significant increase in the number of export destinations, up from 78 markets in 2003 to 129 in 2019.
In the last decade, the Chilean government started to seriously consider public and private investments in the development of agricultural innovation in the country. In collaboration with the World Bank, the government implemented a plan to fund technological agricultural innovations to project the sector into the future. By 2017, the government had begun to work with farmers, private investors, researchers and technology firms to develop functional ingredients and specialty additives of natural origin in Chile. This project had a public investment of $3.6 billion USD.
Technology has played a big role in this boom. Technological improvements enable new varieties, earlier crops and improved quality and improved shelf life for exports. In this episode, we will hear about the public-private relationships, and its value to the produce industry in Chile. First, we will hear from Andres Rodriguez, the agricultural attaché to the U.S. in the Embassy of Chile. He is also a friend and prior employee of PMA. Andres talks about how Chile got from Ag1.0 to now Ag5.0. He also introduces the importance of innovation to the Ministry of Ag in Chile. Innovation is a major pillar, as we will discuss later, with members from the INIA, which is the Ag Research Institute, and the Foundation of Agrarian Innovation, FIA. Let's drop in to the conversation with Andres.
Andres Rodriguez:Today I'm currently the Agricultural Attaché of Chile to the United States and Canada. My background in Chile was mainly related to the trade associations in the agricultural sector, and my last position in Chile was representing PMA for the Chilean members.
Vonnie Estes:Great. We love that. When was that, when were you working with PMA in Chile?
Andres Rodriguez:I worked with PMA in Chile until May 2019. Yeah, so it was very exciting to work with PMA in increasing the memberships and trying to develop more interesting initiatives for the Chilean members. We created different task forces, and webinars, and seminars, and many different things that were very interesting to develop. It was a great challenge.
Vonnie Estes:Some of the listeners to this podcast may not be aware of what food is grown in Chile. Can you tell us what's grown there, and how much is exported, or if it's just grown for the internal market?
Andres Rodriguez:Well, Chile as you know is a small country. We have a population of about 19 million people. But it's got a great potential of agriculture. And we mainly focus on exports, so there is a great proportion of agriculture that it's for our exports. Today, if we consider all the food sector, Chile exports approximately $18 billion in food products, and actually it's the second largest industry after mining. And for far is the main non-mining in Chile. If we consider only the produce sector, today Chile is exporting about $6 billion in fresh fruit, mainly. Basically table grapes, cherries, blueberries, stone fruits, palm fruits, kiwi fruits and some others.
Vonnie Estes:Great. So, this podcast focuses on technology primarily. Can you talk about what technology is being developed and used in Chile in the food supply chain?
Andres Rodriguez:Yeah, well I would say that probably similar to what has happened in the rest of the world, we moved from agriculture 1.0 to agriculture 5.0 where we have that transit from the Asian times of the agriculture, like the basic agriculture, then moving to the use of materials in agriculture that was very important in Chile as well. You see a lot of the use of machinery in the agriculture. And afterward, moving to agriculture 3.0, with the use of high tech sensors of automatization, a lot of that today you see on the fields and also in the facilities that process fruit in Chile.
Then agriculture 4.0, with the use of data, a very data driven technologies, like big data, the use of, for example internet of things, and many other trends that we could see at that point. And today, even reaching the agriculture 5.0, it has more to do with the artificial intelligence, with robotics applied in agriculture as well. So we have seen probably all those trends. Chile has a very long agriculture tradition and history, so we have been developing our own technologies, but also importing many technologies from overseas. Chile is very well connected with the world in this regard, actually Chile is a very open economy, so we are always looking for new technologies, what can be imported, what can be improved, what can we export also to other markets, in many other fields but also in the agriculture.
And I would say that something that probably has been very important especially in the last years has been how to be more efficient in the use of water. So, that has been something crucial that probably, with the climate change and many other factors, the world is facing this huge challenge, and Chile of course is not an exception.
Vonnie Estes:You mentioned that some of the technology is developed there in Chile, so what is the ecosystem for developing ag technology in Chile? What does that look like, and how could it be further developed so that you could have people in-country developing technology for you to use, that understand your market the best?
Andres Rodriguez:Well, I think that today there is a good environment for innovation in general, I would say. Actually if you see the Chilean government, actually for example doing a Zoom in the Ministry of Agriculture, innovation is one of the main pillars of the Ministry of Agriculture. Actually under the Ministry of Agriculture, you have two main agencies that are INIA, that is the Research, Development and Innovation agency, and you have FIA, that is the Agriculture Innovation Foundation, which mainly promotes the innovation in the agriculture sector and the ag food chain.
And besides what the government could do in this regard, we see today that agriculture is much more trendy, I would say, than before. Because usually, years ago when you were thinking about innovation, probably you were not thinking necessarily about agriculture.
Today I would say that especially because Chile is important in agriculture production, all the innovation and the technology, it's also focused in this important field and important sector for Chile. So I would say that besides what the public sector could do in this regard with funding some projects of course, but also working together with the private sector in terms of a strategy nationwide, and how we can approach these common goals.
You see also that there is a different mood in general in the private sector as well. In the universities actually there are some incubators that are also including some agriculture projects within their portfolio, but also even seeing some incubators that are focusing on agricultures specifically. So yeah, so in general I would say that today there is an interesting environment to develop new technologies and innovations related to the agricultural sector.
Vonnie Estes:And it sounds like, with these accelerators and these different companies, who's investing the money to get those going? Is that government, or NGOs, or external money from outside the country? Where's the funding coming from?
Andres Rodriguez:Well, in some cases you see the government, that it's funding. Normally part of those projects, or depending, there are different models of course. But you see some other funds coming from the private sector as well, even from these accelerators or private investors that are interested in increasing the productivity, the yields, or being more efficient in terms of resources in their own companies, or in a certain cluster within the agriculture. So yeah, you see different models, but funds coming from the private and public sector for sure.
Vonnie Estes:Okay. My last question is, you mentioned water and how important that is, and that's important everywhere. Some places it's important because there's too much of it or it falls at the wrong time, but with climate change that's changing, and people are trying to respond. Do you think that's the most important area for technology to be developed for in Chile right now, or what do you see really needs to be developed and moved along?
Andres Rodriguez:Yeah. Well, I would say that for sure one of the main issues in Chile, it's water management. And as you say, probably worldwide. But yeah, beside the water management, that it's one of the main challenges, I would say that today, for example, producing with less pesticides, for example. Being more sustainable in general, not only with the use of water resources, but also the soil erosion, for example. Being more productive, lowering the costs and producing more. I think that the technologies can be very helpful in all those matters.
And also, for example, the traceability. That's something that's been a trend worldwide in agriculture. I think, for example, and especially in the companies that are currently exporting to the States, it is a great aspect to consider, for example with FSMA, this must to be able to have the traceability from the farms to the final customer here in the States. So I think that the technology, the innovation could be of great help to achieve those goals for sure.
Vonnie Estes:We will now hear from Stanley Best, from the Ministry of Agriculture in Chile, INIA, which is the Agriculture Research Institute. Stanley talks about bringing technology to the farm, and how adoption occurs. He also talks about where innovation comes from.
After Stanley, we will hear from Al, who graciously said I could call him Al because no American can pronounce his name. Al is from the Foundation for Agrarian Innovation, or FIA. Al has had a long career in both the public and private sector, and has some great insights on the power of plant breeding, and Chile's adaptation to climate change. First, Stanley.
Stanley Best:Okay, today Agriculture Research Institute of Chile, is the government institution that make, or is in charge of the research in agriculture and forestry in Chile. We have a part of our resources are coming from the government, and another part coming from the private sector. In Chile, we have a mix. It's not just the government that give the resources for the research.
Each money that the government puts, there must be some money from the private sector. With that you make the research more close to the necessities of the sector. And this is the way that we work in here. Our mission is related to the maintenance and sustainability of the agricultural sector, and improve the incomes of the people in the different relative states. The big farmers, medium farmers, and the small farmers, because sometimes they need more help. In the area of research, maybe it's in the healthy part, but in the area of technology and transparency, that maybe is in the lower part of the producers.
Related with myself, I study agronomies as a base, and after made my Master's in agriculture engineering and bio sources in agriculture engineering. It was in U.S., and after I came here and I started running all the research to make with the precision farming. That was the first wave of the technology that we have it around the world. And this opened all the different things related to the technologies, but it was a little lax in the connection with the real life in agriculture. And this, I think in the last five or maybe a little more years, everything changed into the agriculture 4.0 that is more related to the artificial intelligence, they put more knowledge and they analyze all this data that you get from the technologies, machinery, and all these things that they were coming from the precision farming. Pulling down into the connection to the user experience. The farmers and the companies, the lag or the distance between the actual knowledge and the farmers is huge. You need to see how you can pull down all this knowledge into the possibilities of the farmer to use.
This start to change, and with Corona Virus, related what we're doing here, the connection, the communication through the internet, or all the ICPs that they are evolved today with the necessities for the Corona Virus that you cannot go to the fields, or many things like that. Made inquiries in the advance in the technology to set it by the farmers and company, they start to change.
And this in fact will open other things like the possibilities, new regulation and new things that they start to coming from the different sector. In Chile, we are a country in which our agriculture is more supported by the fruit production and wine production, I'm sure you already drink Chilean wines. This is our big business as agriculture. Additional crops, or cattles, or these kind of thing, they are not big in Chile, it's just for something for us. And we have big, big, big countries like Argentina, Brazil, that they are next to us, we cannot compete. In wheat, or in corn, or cattles or other things.
This area is to maintain us in Chile, but our big business is related to fruit production and wineries. And in these areas, we need to improve the quality, the safety issues related to the production, maintain the environment, many things that the commercial area start to searching in this kind of product.
Vonnie Estes:How do you work actually with the producers? Do you have seminars, or when it's not COVID do you go out and visit the farm, or do you have projects that you set up? What's the interaction?
Stanley Best:The interaction between the companies is we're working, really close connection with the companies. Companies see the problem that they have, related with whatever issue, irrigate, infection, whatever. They come in to us, we start to talking, to see the possibilities of solution, and we apply for a grant. That is related with money from the government and money from the companies, and we work with them. And after getting the solution, we open through the seminars and technology transformation of fields, indoors, and we start to make a really connection with companies. Serious companies too, because finally the producers, or the company that produce something, they want a service. They want something that maintain the system by the time. That way we start to working as an institution with this company, not only to support and increase and develop a new area of business that is the technology business to support the company.
In my institution I am the National Director in the Digital and Agriculture. Everything that is related with electronic, informatics or whatever in Chile, I'm in charge of that. And we have 12 different centers around, you know Chile's pretty long.
We have from area with ice and in areas that is the biggest desert in the world. That is quite big differences in weather, in which each area create an environment of development of the producers that is different in the north than in the south. We have different station connection with these companies, and they start to develop new technology and make the knowledge a fit for them with the universities, with the service company, try to create a support, push out the startups and these kind of things.
Vonnie Estes:Where does the technology come from? You mentioned universities, does some of it come out of universities, or are they companies that are being companies in Chile, or is it technology out of the country? Where does the technology come from?
Stanley Best:What we start to see, and I think it's all around the world, private companies, service company, there are so many development of the capacities like tasting that they are in the market right now. Not like in the past, that they were just in the universities or these kind of centers. But today there are a lot of research that is making into the companies too. And in this area, that is more related with the technical things. Sometimes they know the electronic or informatics or these kind of thing, but it doesn't have the connection with the way they work in the field, the agronomy part.
And in this case, we started working with them too, to get advances in this area. This capital is coming from the Chilean companies that they start to create, as well as it's coming from outside from Chile, to Chile through some dealers. That they start to try to sell this kind of technology, but sometime it's difficult because one of the problem that we found with the digitalization of the agriculture is there are different companies. You have the companies of irrigation, you have the company of fertility, you have different company. Sometimes the inter-operation of those companies is not that good.
And a company, for example if I were a vineyard, I want to have just one thing which I can see everything.
And this simple operation, it starts to create, not just in Chile, I think in U.S. and Europe and different areas, that the development start to create a connection through the APIs to get this inter-operation through the different systems. And if you see a little bit high, you start to see big companies like Dole, with the global ending, you see IBM with their system. They start to create this inter-operated environment that they start to combine. And this is what we're talking around now, because with that amount of information you start to create artificial intelligence. You start to create intelligence for the data, to create it specifically. This is what we are in right now, I see it all around the world.
Vonnie Estes:Yeah. What areas of research and solution development needs more work? Do you think it's around this area of artificial intelligence and data analysis, is that the most important thing?
Stanley Best:I think the most important things, it's not in the area of technology development, it's in the refrain. We are a lack of people that understood, as a user. Sometimes you have technology, but their final users doesn't know nothing about this. It's like Chinese, Mandarin.
And it is, in this area I think the technology transfer or the structure of the careers that we have, have not made the evolution that they should have. Because they are not a market, the market is in there but it's growing, it's not big enough to make the change into the universities or the institutions, to create a new issue.
Vonnie Estes:You have a very interesting career. I want to hear about your current role at FIA, and I also want to talk a little bit about your years with DuPont and all the technology you have seen over the years in the country. First, please tell us a little bit about yourself and your career, including your work at FIA.
Alvaro (Al) Eyzaguirre: Okay Vonnie, thank you very much. My name is Alvaro Eyzaguirre. I'm working, actually the Director at the Foundation of Agrarian Innovation at the Ministry of Agriculture of Chile. I have been here since March 2018, and prior to that I spent many years, I did most of my career was at Pioneer DuPont, I was there for 29 years.
Vonnie Estes:How has technology changed agriculture over the decades that you have been involved, in Chile?
Alvaro (Al) Eyzaguirre: Well, it has been great to see all the change. It has been really a huge change when it comes to technologies and agriculture. I had the luck of being working for Dupont Pioneer for those 29 years. I started on research, so it was basically planned reading, and later on the bio technologies I was working on that. It was quite, quite exciting. Later on I moved into the supply management area, which was also a very interesting area on the seed production. And later on I ended working on the business, responsible for the business in Chile, Peru and Bolivia.
The technologies I saw over my career with Pioneer was amazing. Not only as part of Pioneer, which is of course a leading company, today is called Corteva, Pioneer at Dupont. And this company really gave Chile and other countries of the world top breeding materials which really impact the world, the food security when it comes to high yield, resistant to disease or something. But when you think about overall, biotech was really, really important. Planned genetics, very important.
And when it comes today, when we talk about Ag4.0 is today a reality today here in Chile as it does in other countries, it's probably one of the most challenging things on agriculture today in which some countries can go faster than others. However, no matter where you are located in the agriculture chain, you can be a small farmer and you have a lot of big range of opportunities to use this Ag4.0. Or if you are really a top notch farmer, you can also have... There's always a gap. There's always a technology gap which makes this very exciting. The integration of technologies that today we can see, after as I mentioned in all my years I have seen a lot of very, very interesting developments when it comes to mechanics, automation, later on the precision farming and all those things really added value to the process, to the proactivity of this activity.
And today, I would say that it's really, really amazing what artificial intelligence brings, how you can integrate the information. We are operating today with big data. Big data is a tremendous source of quality information that allows, through artificial intelligence, to come out with precise and accurate information for decision making. And that's something that we think that agriculture is working with living plants and animals. All the growth of an animal or a plant is related to many, many factors. You have temperature, you have the nutrition, you have a lot of things which, if you integrate all this you get the perfect formula on what is needed to really achieve the expectation, and on the other hand use the right resources.
Now, today we know climate change is putting tremendous challenges on people. We need to use the resources in the best way. We cannot go and utilize things like the word abundant. Today we think about water, climate change is really, really affecting. And we think about our case in particular in Chile, Chile is one of the countries worldwide that is suffering the most, or is the most affected by this challenge. Chile has seven out of the nine elements that the United Nations has defined as elements that make a country vulnerable. So we are vulnerable among the climate change, and we're seeing. We have faced a bad, bad drought. A long drought, more than 15 years in which we have not seen the rains that we were used to.
That's impacting agriculture, it's impacting the farmers on their decisions. Some farmers are not able to keep doing what they have done over years. Other farmers, with the glass half full, we have tremendous opportunity. We, at our foundation, in which we are devoted to promote and work on innovation, well we take climate change as a big and exciting challenge. We foresee opportunities to do agriculture or plant crops, for example, on areas that never, ever before you would have thought about it. We are producing almonds, in very southern Chile we are producing wine in Patagonia, we're doing a lot of very exciting things, taking advantage of this challenge that can be terrible for many farmers. But on the other hand it offers opportunities.
Vonnie Estes:Yeah, and growing those crops in different places is really important then to have the technology that you were talking about in ag4.0, where you are gathering the data and you're understanding what is happening with the temperature, and the water and all of the at information. So I hadn't thought of that, but that's very smart that you're now saying okay, climate change is happening, it's happening to us, and we have this information and this data that we can use to help us determine where we can grow different crops and move with climate change, because you can't completely stop it. So that's very interesting. My next question is, what has been the most surprising to you? That's what surprising to me, but what has been something that you didn't expect would happen, or you couldn't have predicted early on in your career that's happening now?
Alvaro (Al) Eyzaguirre: All my life I have enjoyed and I have been quite impressed about many, many changes. From very basic farm activities up to high technology things. We think about what communication means, what it means to carry an intelligent mobile on your pocket, and you have access to all the information while you are working your corn out in the field. And that was quite exciting when I was working with Pioneer and doing all the planned reading, I was taking notes out in the field with my laptop, and I was able in the shade of a tree to send all this data to the U.S. and I'm talking about quite a time ago.
So, all these changes have been quite exciting. To me, I would say today, and probably because I'm thinking on the future but enjoying the present, to me agri 4.0 has been the most surprising thing. When we consider this integration of data coming from these sensors, recording the temperature, the air, the soil, and then putting together that with satellite and drone images. And on top of that you get other elements and you do know from signs what a plant or an animal requires to grow in the most efficient and effective way, that's really exciting. And we see today a lot of things that are going on, and at the same time the future, it's amazing.
Something that is very, very important, part of this integration that also excites me a lot. Chile produces a lot of fruits, a lot of food. We are helping feed the world, from being a very small country. However, when it comes to food production, we feel very proud about it. And one of the things that also, besides the nice weather and the soil. Our territory is so broad. We are a very skinny, slim country, however that allow us also to be in a very broad range, a big distance.
Now, something that is also a particular condition from Chile is our light. The sunlight we get here compared to other countries, we do not get any rain at all during the spring and summer time, for example. So most days are clear skies, and compared to other countries in the world it's really a benefit. That allows Chile not only to produce good and healthy food and fruits, et cetera, but also to take advantage or the sun energy. Solar panels are the future in Chile. Chile has the driest and one of the largest desert in the world. That land is not good for farming today, there are opportunities, however it's a tremendous opportunity to generate this energy from sunlight. When we integrate this energy, so low cost energy, together with such a long coast, Chile has 5,000 kilometers of coast, and we have all that ocean, we have all that water there.
So we are suffering from this drought, and we have the ocean there. So there is water. Not the quality water we need for irrigating, however today you can work on that water and have reasonable water for farming, or good quality water for people. And what's the limit there? The limitation on that water direction, coming from the ocean, is energy. But that energy, on the other hand, is becoming cheaper and cheaper. Today solar panels allow you to be very competitive. So, that opens a tremendous, tremendous opportunity for a country like Chile.
Vonnie Estes:My last question is around public and private sector. So you've worked both in the public and the private sector. What role does and should government play in technology development and adoption in ag, and then what role should the private sector play, and how does that work in Chile today?
Alvaro (Al) Eyzaguirre: I feel very lucky, very, very blessed to have had the chance to work in the private industry first, and in the public sector later. I was able to learn, and I have been able to learn, and today I enjoy every day what I am doing, and to learn from the differences and the things that we do have in common. And I would say that overall the big challenge that is required here is to work together. The public sector has a lot to offer. Has great people, has resources, has experience, has a lot of things. And on the other hand, private sector can contribute with other elements. You put both together and you get a tremendous synergy. All the big challenges that we have when it comes to water management, when it comes to food security, we cannot do it alone. No matter how big your company, your private industry, you're not able to accomplish and fight these challenges. And on the other hand, the governments along cannot do it. So there is tremendous opportunity. That's a very optimistic and positive message. Together we can absolutely produce much more.
Vonnie Estes:After hearing from the private sector, we will now hear from Gaston Dussaillant Venezian, from Capta Hydro, a company that designs, develops and markets innovative technologies to improve water distribute in irrigation canal networks. Gaston is a classic serial entrepreneur, and it's fascinating to hear his journey in Chile to tackle two of the biggest issues, water and labor.
Gaston Dussaillant Venezian:My name is Gaston Dussaillant, I'm one of the co-founders of Capta Hydro. Capta Hydro is a water technology startup, we're dedicated to the development of internet of things solutions for surface water management. Basically what we're trying to do is to have a much more adaptable, more persisting hardware devices that allow our customers to think in hundreds and thousands of devices installed in their infrastructure. And also software that really helps them solve their water challenges.
Vonnie Estes:What are the problems that you're trying to solve for your customers with the technology you've developed?
Gaston Dussaillant Venezian: Thanks. First, it's helpful to think, we have two main customer segments. One is the surface water distribution organizations, that in California you know them as the River Districts, or Irrigation districts. On the other hand, we have any organization that uses surface water. That can be farms, agri-business, hydro power companies, utilities and distributors.
The problem that we're trying to solve for them is basically the low efficiency, precision and really low flexibility of the current surface water distribution infrastructure. Which can account for thousands of lost acre-foot per year, and nobody really knows where those losses are, and how much they are, and how to solve them.
The thing is that lots of these losses come from major problems. It's not only seepage in operation, but really that they quickly solved with IAT solutions that allow you to monitor in real time the water flows and also to control them in real time. This problem, for many years it wasn't really a problem, where we had more water and less water demand. But as you know, here in Chile, in California, because of climate change, you have increasing drought, you have much higher water demands, particularly from more permanent crops that have a better water security. There's also environmental relations that are okay because we need the rivers to have water, but all this has resulted in much higher prices for water as we have seen in California this year, and those are prices that we jeopardize the future of some of activities, especially for agriculture. So it's an important problem to solve, to try to recover these lost volumes, and I think that this is one of the most efficient ways to do it.
Vonnie Estes:And what countries are you working in? You're in Chile, are you in other countries as well?
Gaston Dussaillant Venezian: Yeah, so we are mainly in Chile. We are also working in Mexico, we have a pilot project in Baja-California, in Mexicali. Also we have plans to do really a roll out for pilots in many different places in Mexico. And also we're trying to do our first pilots in California in this irrigation system. We're supported by the Value Ventures Accelerator in Fresno State University, so through them we also have spoken with irrigation districts. I'm trying really to understand what are the specific problems in California and to adapt our solutions to offer them this year and next year, target.
Vonnie Estes:So, when you say pilot projects, are those projects that you support and fund, or what makes a pilot project, as opposed to a paid project?
Gaston Dussaillant Venezian: We understand that most of our customers know other solutions, so they will be a bit skeptic and want to know okay, what's different? Our telemetry device for surface water has a lot of differences, and one of them is that it's really easy to install, and to transport, and it's very modular. So we can send it through flight shipping, and the customer can install it basically by consulting a couple operators. So that flexibility allows us to offer these pilots in a very practical and for almost no cost for the customer. And we're willing for the first ones to do them without cost for the device, they have only to pay for the shipping. It's part of our entry to the market.
Vonnie Estes:Yeah. So, how many projects total do you have going on in these different areas?
Gaston Dussaillant Venezian:Mainly in Chile we have around 120 devices installed. They vary from the flood gate and canal gate automation, and also to telemetry devices. They have different models, some measure water height, others measure water flow directly. We also have some ground water telemetry that's more like a complementary business. But we are expecting high growth this year or next probably to reach 1,000 devices in the next couple years.
Vonnie Estes:Turning a little bit to your background, I was reading up on you and I read that you founded a number of other companies that have been in software and mining and different industries. What got you interested in irrigation, and looking at solving problems in agriculture and water?
Gaston Dussaillant Venezian: Yeah, thanks for the question, Vonnie. Really I'm 32, I've been an entrepreneur basically the last 10 years. And honestly, it was more luck that I got into water. I'm happy it was that way. I started with the software for retail, didn't really like it. It was just to make retailers richer. And then the mining was kind of like a year, but I also didn't really like the industry. I got into water really by... It was pure luck, because we started the company as a energy technology company for micro hydro power, and the idea was to do hydrokinetic turbines for artificial canals. We were two years into the business, we had some pilots, but we were talking constantly to irrigation districts, river districts, and we realized that energy generation was not their main priority. Number one, two and three was water distribution.
We started to get in to understand the problems, and we realized that one of the important solutions that could be this IOT monitoring and control devices. There were so much need, and there was this big gap between the amount of devices that were needed and the ones that were installed. Because of cost, vandalism, adaptability, a series of issues. And that's where we decided to basically pivot the company 100%, it was three years ago, into irrigation management and water management solutions.
Vonnie Estes:One of the things I'm trying to do with these podcasts, and looking at different countries, is looking at what's the ecosystem like there and what it's like to actually start companies there. So you may not have a comparison, but was it difficult to start your company in Chile? And how did you get funding, and how did you get started?
Gaston Dussaillant Venezian: I think to start wasn't that difficult, because in Chile we have lots of pre-seed subsidies, especially for innovative and technology-based companies. But what was really a challenge is once you already spend those subsidies, was to get the further funding for that initial growth, before our break even we're reaching this year. So that was a big challenge. We were lucky to have some angel investors, friends and family mainly, and also we had some debt between the partners that we were able to get. But we realized that that's not necessarily the situation of most Chilean entrepreneurs. Many get into this funding gap, they don't know angel investors, angel investing is not really such a common activity here between wealthy people. They prefer many times to invest in their own companies more than in someone else's so that's a challenge.
And also, the next stage for us now is to raise our serious hay. And really, even though we'll talk obviously with Chilean investors, we're also looking outside Chile. We'll talk with Mexican, also North American investors to see. Because what we're trying to solve is really a global problem, and obviously not limited to Chile.
Vonnie Estes:Yeah. Are there a lot of startup companies in Chile that are focused on agriculture, or is that not a growing segment as much?
Gaston Dussaillant Venezian: Yeah, it is a growing segment. In fact, there are a couple that come to mind right now, a couple that are doing quite well in California right now. One with water filtration, it's Biofitlro. Another with precision agriculture is WiseConn. Those already have done some good inroads for us that we're following behind. And also the agricultural sector in Chile has grown so much in, I would say the last 20 years. Fruit exporting is now one of the main businesses, main exporting industries in Chile. Particularly cherries, I think they're growing like 30% a year every year and sending them to China.
Vonnie Estes:Wow, I didn't know that. Yeah.
Gaston Dussaillant Venezian: It's almost a $2 billion a year business now. But all this growth has its challenges, right? One of the main challenges is probably water management, that's the big limitation to keep on growing the production. And lots of startups have tried to develop solutions at different stages of the water needs of agricultural businesses.
Vonnie Estes:Yeah, somebody interviewed me yesterday for a podcast I was on and he asked me what I thought the two biggest challenges were. I said labor and water. And those are two things-
Gaston Dussaillant Venezian: Yeah-
Vonnie Estes:... I don't work on as much, but I think those are the two big challenges, yeah.
Gaston Dussaillant Venezian: I was going to say labor as a second big challenge. It was really exacerbated this year by COVID and obviously immigration restrictions. So yeah, that's another big opportunity I think, lots of startups are focused on trying to solve and automate some jobs. And in fact it's kind of what we're doing. When we install a telemetry device, or when we install a gate automation device, really what we're doing is automating a really mundane task that a person had to go and visually look, once a day, how much water there was, and operate the gate. So everything is trending to that.
Vonnie Estes:Yeah. Yeah, that makes sense. We've seen a lot of change in COVID where people didn't want to rely on technology. Even if they had technology, there were like, ""Oh, I'm just going to go look."" And now, since we can't move around so much, I've seen better adoption where people are actually willing to look at the data. And the data is often better, or the task is actually done better by sensors and by information. Yeah, yeah, than actually doing it yourself. So that may, of all the horrible things around COVID, that might be a good thing that comes out of it.
Gaston Dussaillant Venezian: Yeah.
Vonnie Estes:It was great to learn about the produce industry in Chile in this episode. Chile's public and private investment in fruit production is why we here in the U.S. are able to eat many fruits year-round. Partnerships between innovation companies, the state and venture capitalists have provided great technical advances in the country, and result in me getting to eat blueberries all year.

Vonnie Estes, PMA:Welcome to PMA Takes on Tech, the podcast that explores the problems, solutions, people and ideas that are shaping the future of the produce industry. I'm your host, Vonnie Estes, Vice-President of Technology for the Produce Marketing Association, and I've spent years in the ag tech sector, so I can attest, it's hard to navigate this ever-changing world in developing and adopting new solutions to industry problems.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:Thanks for joining us and for allowing us to serve as your guide to the new world of produce and technology. My goal of the podcast is to outline a problem in the produce industry and then discuss several possible solutions that can be deployed today.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:Stout Industrial Technology collaborates with customers to build and launch industrial technology solutions that are designed to last. The Smart Cultivator combines a proprietary, agriculturally-proven mechanical platform with Stout True Vision technology to eliminate weeds and cultivate ground in a single pass. Visit stoutagtech.com, that's S-T-O-U-T-A-G-T-E-C-H.com, to learn more.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:Welcome to Part Two of the Focus on Israel. If you missed Episode 22, I recommend you listen to it as well, where we featured FruitSpec, Clarifruit, Copia Agro and Food Technologies Fund and Tal-Ya Agriculture Solutions. It was a very full and long episode.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:This week, we return to Israel, as I really couldn't pack any more into Episode 22. In today's episode, we continue to look at innovation coming out of Israel, and why. We talk to two companies, NRGene and CropX, and then finish up with hearing about the Israel Innovation Institute.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:These three speakers, along with the four from the previous episode, demonstrate the entrepreneurship and innovation coming out of Israel to help feed the world. Let's start with NRGene. We speak to Gil Ronen, founder and CEO of NRGene. Gil has been working with plant genetics for over 25 years. I've been aware of his work in this company and his previous company.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:What I find amazing is how his company was very cutting-edge 11 years ago when they started, and with all the big technical advances, they still are. Let's drop in to the conversation.
Gil Ronen, NRGENE Ltd.:I'm Gil. I did a PhD in Plant Genomics. Everything, all my professional career, I was in the genomic companies developing high-end AI tool and make them available to make better seed, better animal breed, et cetera. This is for myself. If we count the PhD as well, it's now 25 years.
Gil Ronen, NRGENE Ltd.:With NRGene, we started NRGene 11 years ago with the very simple, but straightforward idea to say that there's so much data that we can help in choosing the best seed for every farmer, so while develop the tool that can analyze this data and enable on the computer to find the best genetic combination for every crop, for every geography. This is exactly what we do from the day we started until today.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:There's a number of people thinking like that now, but 11 years ago, breeders weren't thinking like that. That was pretty revolutionary thinking.
Gil Ronen, NRGENE Ltd.:Yeah. There were few things that were very different 11 years ago. First, in every significant breeding entity, there is the actual breeding, the classical, the natural breeding, which is done routinely every year, every season, and there was the biotech part.
Gil Ronen, NRGENE Ltd.:The biotech part was where all the new innovation tools that are non-natural like GMO and gene editing, et cetera, this is where those part were tested the different technologies, and very rarely they were merged into a product. In most cases, even today, most crops and animal are all naturally bred.
Gil Ronen, NRGENE Ltd.:The technology, the high tech was not involved to that level in the natural breeding, which again, in our understanding, this is a waste of a resource, and this is why we try to change. This was one thing that it was really thinking differently, but then, when we try to realize how much data we need to analyze and what are the tools that are necessary, if you do breeding of tomatoes, for example, so you have thousands of different plant, each of them with different genetic combination, and each of them have about one billion letters in the DNA.
Gil Ronen, NRGENE Ltd.:You have really a huge amount of information you need to accumulate. You need to store it and you need to analyze in order to find the very basic differences in the DNA that make one tomato taste better than other. This was something that people didn't believe any computer can handle, and even the cloud where they do at the very beginning, they didn't believe it's possible.
Gil Ronen, NRGENE Ltd.:They say Amazon doesn't have enough cloud power to do this level of analysis. What we did, we try to shrink the data, to condense it to a way that a machine, a computer can handle, and then we can analyze all the data and find those genes, the beneficial genes.
Gil Ronen, NRGENE Ltd.:This is something even a very, very sophisticated cloud computing company didn't believe this is possible to do, and this is what our challenge, and I'm very happy to say that now we are successful and now many others do similar things.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:Who are your customers now? What types of companies do you work with and what's an end product for them that you develop?
Gil Ronen, NRGENE Ltd.:Within the value chain, there are companies that develop new seeds or new animal breeds for farmers and sell them to farmers. Farmer that grow wheat, for example, every year they buy new band of seed of wheat and they sold them and they grow them and they put fertilizing and wait for the rain, et cetera, or irrigate them, and eventually get the yield.
Gil Ronen, NRGENE Ltd.:Every year, they could get different varieties of seed, and these new varieties is supposed to be more productive, more efficient, resilient, better drought or other stresses or different pathogen. We work with the companies that constantly developing new seed for the farmer and new animal breed for the farmer to make the farming more productive.
Gil Ronen, NRGENE Ltd.:Those are the companies. There are two types of companies. The company that this is actually their business, they are called seed companies or breeding companies. They are your giant companies in this space like Bayer, Syngenta and Corteva and BASF and Limagrain and KWS. They're all working with NRGene today. This is one type.
Gil Ronen, NRGENE Ltd.:Another type is companies that say I produce food or I produce a beverage or I produce rubber or I produce alpo paper, and I need to make sure that farmers grow the best raw material for me. If I'm a chocolate company, I need to make sure that farmers grow the highest-quality cocoa. If I'm not able to do that, then I'm losing my business.
Gil Ronen, NRGENE Ltd.:Some of those companies now more and more take the responsibility on developing new varieties of coffee or cocoa or rubber trees or eucalyptus for paper, and this way they make sure the raw material they made will be produced to the highest quality. This is the other type. This is the industrial companies like food and beverage companies, et cetera, that are involved in breeding because they cannot afford having not the highest quality of the raw material for their end product.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:Companies like that, do they have the germ plasm or do you work in public germ plasm? Where does the germ plasm come from?
Gil Ronen, NRGENE Ltd.:This is very good question. Seed companies that sells into pharma, usually they own their own germ plasm. It's very broad, it's very diverse. We have the whole plain ground to sexually-cross between different varieties and choose the best progenies, the best seeds for the next generation.
Gil Ronen, NRGENE Ltd.:In the food and beverage and other industrial companies, sometimes they have their own genetic material, and sometimes they rely on other resources. It could be public resources, it could be some academia that work, for example, do breeding of cocoa in Africa or something like that.
Gil Ronen, NRGENE Ltd.:This way, now we need a three-way collaboration between the end producer like the chocolate maker, the breeder which is academia that do, maybe it's breeding of cocoa, and ourselves. In many cases, this is the current situation. We can handle with that. We know how to work with all breeders of all crops and bring the value.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:If you were working with, say, a chocolate company or a food company like that, if they came to you and they said, ""We want a certain trait,"" how long would it normally take before they'd actually have that trait? I know it depends, of course, but is it 10 years? Is it five years? What's the range?
Gil Ronen, NRGENE Ltd.:It depends on the lifecycle of the organism, the crop you work with, because we are advanced from one generation to another generation. If we work in cannabis, that you have a single generation in 10 weeks, so it's move very fast. If we work with cocoa, that a single generation could be six or seven years, it moves pretty slow.
Gil Ronen, NRGENE Ltd.:In those cases, the companies actually need our technology more because what we do, we predict, for a given genetic combination, how the plant will perform in the field. If our predictions are accurate, they can select the best individual before they can realize the full potential of the specific plant that can take five or six years. The longer the lifecycle, the more they need us.
Gil Ronen, NRGENE Ltd.:If we take a chocolate company, of course they want the highest-quality cocoa, but they need a farmer to grow the plant, and in some regions, because of climate change, there are more seasons of drought or heat or there is a new fungal disease that spread and they need to be able to cope with it, et cetera.
Gil Ronen, NRGENE Ltd.:They don't want to spray chemicals because they don't want the chocolate to have a ... chocolate with chemicals, no one wants that. We want it to be as clean, as natural as possible. They are coming to us. We are talking to the breeders and they say, ""We have very good cocoa trees that resist drought and very good cocoa trees that resist this fungi. We have very good-quality cocoa trees, but this is different tree. It's not everything in one.""
Gil Ronen, NRGENE Ltd.:They ask us to make everything in a single tree. What we do, we do two things. First, we do sexual crosses between those trees that contribute different genes or different traits of interest, and we analyze the full genomic makeup and we actually identify on the computer what are the genes that increase the quality, what are the genes that give the resistance to the fungal disease and what are the genes that help the plant tolerate drought.
Gil Ronen, NRGENE Ltd.:Now, we can do on the computer and we can predict which of the next progeny will have the genetic combination that will bring all the traits together. Then, they can take them after the crosses, a few, two months after the crosses, they can select the most successful plants according to our prediction.
Gil Ronen, NRGENE Ltd.:Now they can grow and focus only on them. It will probably take years before they realize that all our predictions are true, but at least they don't need to grow hundreds of thousands of trees and wait for so long. They can focus on those.
Gil Ronen, NRGENE Ltd.:Because we completed close to 300 projects and our prediction rates are so high, relying on our technology is the best bet they had. This way, instead of getting the same trees in 20 years from now because they need three full generation, they can get it in a single lifecycle or two. We cut significantly the time from the moment they realize this is what the new variety they need until it's ready to use.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:You recently went public and hired some new senior staff. Congratulations on that. Where do you see NRGene going? What are you planning on going forward with the money you've raised and the staff? Are you going in different directions?
Gil Ronen, NRGENE Ltd.:In the first years, we build the best technical staff. We are located in Israel. We have 40 technical staff, many data scientists, and they work with software engineers and mathematicians and others, and geneticists of course. They are all working together. This is the brain. This is the brain of the company, and this is the people that make those tools that can resolve very, very tough genetic challenges.
Gil Ronen, NRGENE Ltd.:Now, of course we are in Israel and we are very good in ag tech, but Israel is very, very small in ag. We have very little land. We have very expensive water. We are not that big in ag. Actually, our technology is required in the US, in Canada, in Brazil, in China, in India, et cetera. This is the place where the technology is required.
Gil Ronen, NRGENE Ltd.:In order to work closely with the companies that produce the seed for farmers, we need to be also close with the farmers and the grain producers on the value chain. The way we expect to grow is to put a local entity that do the actual project hand in hand with the customers, or that now become more collaborators than customers.
Gil Ronen, NRGENE Ltd.:This way, we better realize the need, we have immediate use of the technology, et cetera. However, the same brain, the same AI software and the people will run it, we can have one in Israel. We can have 10 different location when we work closely with our customers or collaborators and do the all analysis on the cloud with a single tech team that is very special. They've very unique globally, with very unique capabilities, but they can serve all those project.
Gil Ronen, NRGENE Ltd.:This is the idea. By doing that, not only we come closer to the customers and we work more efficiently, we are also entitled to co-own the new IP, the new seeds that we produce together, and get royalties from the sale of the seeds for the farmer.
Gil Ronen, NRGENE Ltd.:We are commercial company, so revenue is also important. We try to feed the world and we hope we do something to improve food availability, but still, we try also to generate more revenue, but by the way of getting the revenue model of royalty or revenue share. Over there, of course the market is way bigger and the opportunity for the company is greater. This is on one end.
Gil Ronen, NRGENE Ltd.:On the other end, our customers, we work together with them, so if there's no product in the end, we don't get any revenue. We take a risk on the short term with the big opportunity on the long term, because if you develop a new tomato seed variety or a cannabis strain or banana, usually it's the same variety have a significant market share for years. It's not a single year. It could be anywhere from three, four years to 20 years.
Gil Ronen, NRGENE Ltd.:The fact that we do one effort and then get annual revenues for many years, of course, increase the potential of this project in terms of a revenue for the company. This is the way we believe we need to move forward. Actually, it was announced, but it was in Hebrew, so maybe some of the audience missed that, that we opened a lab in Saskatchewan in Canada-
Vonnie Estes, PMA:Oh!
Gil Ronen, NRGENE Ltd.:... to serve the collaborators we work with, yes, in many, many of the key Canadian crops like wheat, canola of course, some of the legume. We have some projects for alternative protein from legume, cannabis and hemp, and other stuff that is very commonly produced in Canada. It makes a lot of sense to be there.
Gil Ronen, NRGENE Ltd.:We actually now have five people on the ground in Saskatchewan, and this is growing and probably will be doubled by the end of the year. We hope this lab will start to operate and do R&D projects very soon.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:Great. I have one last question for you. This episode is focused on Israel, and I've talked to a bunch of amazing companies. What has been the advantage of starting your company there, besides the fact you live there?
Gil Ronen, NRGENE Ltd.:This is a big advantage, yeah. I think Israel is one of the best place for innovation, for several reasons. First, and the most important, you have a lot of relevant, excellent people. If you think of it, if you are a software engineer, I'm not sure working in a startup, working in ag tech is something that is on your radar, but in Israel, it is.
Gil Ronen, NRGENE Ltd.:In Israel, because there are many architect and biotech companies and because some of this software engineer is used to work three years here, three years there, and sometimes it's in a very, very company, and because we have the high tech hub, we have a lot of real excellent people.
Gil Ronen, NRGENE Ltd.:Actually, if I think what is the one thing that makes us special is the people. Actually, because they are moving from different companies and different industries, they are very open-minded. It's not like one software engineer work in some kind of a single company for 20 years. They are very open-minded. They are trained and they are practiced to solve challenges that they didn't even think of before, et cetera.
Gil Ronen, NRGENE Ltd.:This is the treasure. This is the treasure, and I think to find ... now we have 40 people that come from so different backgrounds that can work together, speak together and be able to develop a product together, this is something that is very unique. Again, I was fortunate to hire the right people. This is the key to NRGene's success, no question about. This is one thing.
Gil Ronen, NRGENE Ltd.:The other thing is, again, although we are Israelis, the global companies tend to work with Israeli companies because they have a good experience. They know we are not working by the book and it's not the most organized organization; however, we are very innovative and we are very flexible.
Gil Ronen, NRGENE Ltd.:They are not surprised if a new innovation is coming from Israeli tech company, and this is actually open door for us. If you say you are from Israel and you approach a company like there, Syngenta, they say, ""Oh, this is so and so. Let's see what their new ideas are now.""
Gil Ronen, NRGENE Ltd.:I was part of the fact that we build this brand of Israeli ag tech, but it started way before I was there. This many, four, five decades of this level of experience, et cetera, it pays itself. This is I believe the second thing.
Gil Ronen, NRGENE Ltd.:The third is that it's relatively easy in Israel to get what we call seed money. Seed money, the money to start a company, not the seed business with the seed money. It's relatively easy because there are many early-stage investor. Some of them are private investors, what we call angels, some of them are venture capital entities, and there is matchup fund from the government usually.
Gil Ronen, NRGENE Ltd.:If you are young company and doing pure R&D, you get some matchup fund from the Israeli Innovation Authority. This of course helps you move very faster. I think this is the three main elements that makes Israel the best place to start an ag tech company.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:The next conversation is with Matan Rahav of CropX. CropX is as high-tech to sensors as NRGene is to genetics. This is a fascinating conversation about sensors, water savings, the cloud, and AWS.
Matan Rahav, CropX Technologies:My name is Matan. I handle business development at CropX. I joined about two and a half years ago. My background is actually soil and water sciences. During my master's degree, I've conducted a research at a commercial citrus orchard, and that was when I played around with just about any type of soil-sensing technology that was available at that time.
Matan Rahav, CropX Technologies:When I saw what CropX was doing, I immediately fell in love with the solution and I basically came here knocking on the door, asking for a job. I haven't looked back since. CropX is an agricultural analytics company that revolutionized and automated the farm decision-making process, mostly around irrigation and nutrition management, by developing the world's first, and only, I think, farm management platform that based on real-time soil data, measured by proprietary, self-installed sensors that we developed in-house.
Matan Rahav, CropX Technologies:We started selling our product in 2018 and we were able to scale quite rapidly. Last year, we became the leading company in the world in terms of real-time installing data points, with almost 9,000 installations worldwide.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:Wow. What's different about your soil sensors? There's other soil sensors out there. What's different about yours and what kind of information does it give that's different than the other ones?
Matan Rahav, CropX Technologies:I would say that it revolves around four main points. The first is the scalability. The fact that our hardware is self-installed based on do-it-yourself approach means that we don't have to physically travel for new projects. It doesn't require our boots on the ground.
Matan Rahav, CropX Technologies:Our sensor takes just one minute to install. Anyone can do it. It doesn't require any calibration or maintenance at all, so it's plug-and-play. This allows us to be the most scalable solution in the market.
Matan Rahav, CropX Technologies:The second point is the fact that we close the loop. We don't only focus on above-ground data or below-ground data, but we represent the entire soil-plant-atmosphere continuum. With our proprietary hardware, the satellite imagery that we integrate into the platform, and we integrate many additional data layers like topography, crop models, hydraulic models, soil maps and more.
Matan Rahav, CropX Technologies:Everything gets crunched in the cloud so that we can provide actionable insights, not just raw data, but bottom line, how we can help farmers make better decisions. Everything is done in-house. We have a very large team of engineers, software engineers, hardware engineers, data scientists, agronomists. We have all the expertise in-house to be able to make an impact.
Matan Rahav, CropX Technologies:The third very significant advantage is that we're backed by a world-class syndicate of strategic investors, like Google's Eric Schmidt's private fund, Innovation Endeavors. He fell in love with CropX because of our vision to become the Google on soil.
Matan Rahav, CropX Technologies:We have Flex and Bosch and Sumitomo Corporation, a giant Japanese trading company, and Reinke, one of the world's largest irrigation system manufacturer, Finistere, that's one of the world's largest ag food VCs. We have a great syndicate of investors that helped us scale rapidly.
Matan Rahav, CropX Technologies:The fourth and last point is that I think we're the only ag tech startup that is already starting to position itself as the market consolidator. I know that you wanted to ask me about that later, but we've already made two acquisitions and we're currently involved in another acquisition that hopefully I'll be able to announce publicly soon.
Matan Rahav, CropX Technologies:I think this already proves that we're not a very young startup. We're already mature. The market syndicate technology risks, these are all behind us. Now really our key focus is our continuing growth via strategic partnerships and acquisitions.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:Let's touch on that now. I thought that was really interesting when I was reading about the company is that most companies at your stage aren't making acquisitions. Talk a little bit about why you decided to make acquisitions and what that brought to you as a company.
Matan Rahav, CropX Technologies:Sure. First of all, I would say that you can divide acquisitions into two main objectives. One would be the technology behind it, and the other would be the channel.
Matan Rahav, CropX Technologies:For us, we examine both opportunities as they present themselves. The COVID pandemic created a lot of interesting opportunities that were brought to our doorstep even without us actively looking for opportunities, which is interesting.
Matan Rahav, CropX Technologies:With the first acquisition, CropMetrics, it was mostly around the channels. CropMetrics started bottom-up. They're not a VC-backed company that started top to bottom. Really it started by farmers to farmers, very local, US-based, irrigation management platform that integrated a third-party soil sensor.
Matan Rahav, CropX Technologies:They, too, realized that they had to close the loop and get below and above-ground data to be able to provide interesting insights and actionable insights, but they didn't develop their own hardware. They used a third-party soil sensor, which prevented them from being able to scale the way we did.
Matan Rahav, CropX Technologies:When we acquired them, they already developed a well-oiled solution channel of 150 dealers serving 1,000 clients with a very high retention rate and 500,000 acres under management and over 10 years of agricultural data collected in their platform. With that acquisition, we managed to get an amazing channel into the US farmers segment and to add a lot of agricultural data into our platform.
Matan Rahav, CropX Technologies:Going back to the second acquisition, it was a little bit different. Regen is the company that we've acquired in New Zealand. They were founded also in 2010, also a well-established brand that have become a local leader in effluent irrigation management. That acquisition allowed CropX first to get a foothold into a new market, New Zealand, and a new product in a new high-value use case, interesting effluent irrigation and the entire dairy industry.
Matan Rahav, CropX Technologies:Before that acquisition, when we started, we were focused on irrigation management. Then slowly we've developed into nutrient management, but for crops, and that really unveiled a completely new market for us, which is the dairy industry. That was thanks to this acquisition.
Matan Rahav, CropX Technologies:Also, that has increased our sustainability offering, helping farmers prevent runoff and leeching of cow manure, basically. Also, we've added I think over 100,000 acres under management in New Zealand, including some very important strategic corporate customers that Regen were serving.
Matan Rahav, CropX Technologies:This also strengthened our sales network. With ag tech, it's very important to flatten out your seasonality curve, because what if you only operate in the US? Then your season is around three months, and then in the remaining year, you basically have to sit down and wait and prepare for the next season.
Matan Rahav, CropX Technologies:By opening the New Zealand market, we were basically able to have business all long year long, and obviously, recurring revenues from hundreds of active farm clients with a very high retention rate. All of these things were made possible thanks to this acquisition.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:What geographies are you in, then? You're in New Zealand, you're in the US, you're in Israel. Where else are you?
Matan Rahav, CropX Technologies:Almost everywhere, apart for Antarctica these days.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:This must be partly because it's not a complicated installation process, so you don't have to have people everywhere, so you're really able to scale in a way that other companies probably can't if they have to have people on the ground everywhere, right?
Matan Rahav, CropX Technologies:Exactly. Usually, when you have a product that is not do-it-yourself like ours, it's usually by first opening a local presence that allows other companies to provide the installation support services, but we don't have to do that.
Matan Rahav, CropX Technologies:We can reach anywhere with our Zoom meetings and shipping the sensors to be installed by the user. Yes, that allowed us to scale very rapidly and to be able to get to many new places. We have deployments in countries that I never even traveled to in my life. Sometimes I envy my sensors.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:You wish you could go along with them. You had mentioned COVID earlier, that it had brought some opportunities. How else has COVID affected the company and your deployment?
Matan Rahav, CropX Technologies:The global pandemic actually served as a great opportunity for CropX. We were very lucky in this regard. Yes, we had sufficient funding and inventory, but more than all, it is our do-it-yourself approach that allowed us to scale very rapidly even during the pandemic.
Matan Rahav, CropX Technologies:We continued shipping thousands of systems. We actually broke our sales record in that year, and that was thanks to our do-it-yourself approach. That is when all other companies had to stop all new projects because it requires their physical presence or their boots on the ground, but we managed business as usual. We were very lucky in this regard.
Matan Rahav, CropX Technologies:Also, I would say that during that time, farmers even realized more than ever the importance of being able to remotely monitor their fields. Ag tech got a huge boost during this time.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:I think we've seen that throughout the whole supply chain, all the way from on the farm through harvesting through shipping product, that people that were used to seeing everything with their eyes had to finally rely on the technology in all those different points.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:We've seen an uptick of lots of different technologies from shipping and storage and through the supply chain as well. It'll be interesting, as we look back, what a big impact of leap forward technology took during COVID because people couldn't look with their eyes. They had to depend on it.
Matan Rahav, CropX Technologies:Exactly. It's almost forced adoption and accelerated adoption. Yeah, definitely.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:Exactly. I have a geeky question for you. I read that you are using AWS. One of the challenges in the industry right now is the need to build and use analytic tools, which, not everyone has that ability. The question is often, do we build or do we buy or do we use a service? How did you decide, and how did you think about that? Maybe that happened before you joined the company, but how do people talk about it?
Matan Rahav, CropX Technologies:First of all, I think there is no right answer or a formula to this question. It really depends on what the organization is trying to do. We as an Israeli startup, we knew that we could very easily recruit a powerful team that could do that maybe better than anyone else.
Matan Rahav, CropX Technologies:We knew that there are many things that we are going to build ourselves, and obviously when you develop it yourselves, you have more control of the entire supply chain, including, by the way, hardware manufacturing. We assemble the sensors in Israel. We do everything here.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:Oh, wow.
Matan Rahav, CropX Technologies:There's a lot going on. It's very interesting. There are some things that we're considering to acquire because it will be faster than it would be than to develop it ourselves.
Matan Rahav, CropX Technologies:We spent several years in perfecting our hardware and our current platform, and we understand the time and effort it takes to get there. We understand that to develop products that are very different than what we are doing right now, if it's completely unrelated, it will take maybe the same time that it did to get where we are right now.
Matan Rahav, CropX Technologies:It might be interesting for other technologies that we're considering integrating into our platform to buy instead of building, and this is also something that we're actually doing at the moment. I've mentioned the potential acquisition earlier that you will hopefully hear about-
Vonnie Estes, PMA:Great.
Matan Rahav, CropX Technologies:... hopefully soon.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:I have one more question for you. These two episodes that I'm doing on Israel, as I mentioned, is featuring Israeli companies. What do you see are the advantages of starting a company in Israel, and are there ways that the ecosystem could be better?
Matan Rahav, CropX Technologies:I think we are very lucky to have been established in Israel. I think Israel has one of the most successful, vibrant innovation ecosystem.
Matan Rahav, CropX Technologies:First of all, Israel is a small place. It's very easy to get connected to all different industries and verticals. Just walking around the block, you can see people that have served in technological units in the Army, or you have farmers that are right next to your doorstep, and the kibbutz movement that I told you about before we had this call.
Matan Rahav, CropX Technologies:Israel is the perfect ... with different technological backgrounds, different experience in a small place. Israel is one of the first country that have invested in what the public sector had invested in private sectors' and academic sectors' R&D. That really created a very interesting type of relationship between the academic sector, the private sector and the public sector in Israel.
Matan Rahav, CropX Technologies:There's so many communities for every different industry. There's a planet tech, there's desert tech, there's water tech, there's everything tech. Everything has a very vibrant community, such that the different people from the different parts of the industry could engage and brainstorm.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:I want to hear more about the ag tech ecosystem in Israel, and it certainly seems you are the person to talk to. Please tell me about yourself and the Israel Innovation Institute.
Doron Meller, Israel Innovation Institute:Nice to meet. My name is Doron Meller. I'm the VP of the Israel Innovation Institute. It's a small NGO, nonprofit, non-revenue, managed around six innovation communities. Growing IL, the active community, is among them.
Doron Meller, Israel Innovation Institute:What we're trying to do is we're trying to do two major thing. First of all, we're trying to do an ecosystem development. This mean that we want to create and connect all the relevant players in the ecosystem in one sector, let's say the agritech, this is one time, and help the companies, the entrepreneurs and the connection between all of them, et cetera.
Doron Meller, Israel Innovation Institute:The second thing, we want to create better connection between what we call the demand and the supply. The demand is the market itself, its innovation challenges. It could be a agribusiness company or a farmer region, et cetera. We have the other and we have the supply innovative solution, which means that startup companies and so on, and what we are doing is open innovation processes who can better connecting both side over to get to a pilot better site implementation and so on.
Doron Meller, Israel Innovation Institute:We do it and what we consider the impact sector like digital, health, smart implementation, agrifood tech, desert tech, climate change and so on. This is more or less the Innovation Institute. I manage also Growing IL as one of the communities.
Doron Meller, Israel Innovation Institute:What we're working together with the government, in this case the Ministry of Economy, Ministry of Agriculture and Innovation, Israel Innovation Authority, what we're trying to do is create better and bigger ag tech ecosystem in terms of more companies, more investments in growth stage, more employees, more solution towards the globe, and also to help the local industry. This is more or less Growing IL and the Innovation Institute.
Doron Meller, Israel Innovation Institute:About the Israeli ag tech ecosystem, I think it's one of the maybe top dynamic ecosystem in the sector of ag tech in the world. It's at around 500 company techs, among them 300 startup. Let's say that relatively to the US, it's small numbers, but per capita, it's maybe number one in the world.
Doron Meller, Israel Innovation Institute:Just mention AgFunder report in 2020 that currently, the Israeli agri food ecosystem raised around $480 million, which is not ... again, relative to the US, it's very small, but per capita, it's first in the world. Beside the companies, we have I would say living research institutes such as the Volcani Institute, the Hebrew University and Weizmann Institute.
Doron Meller, Israel Innovation Institute:You can connect this the general, I would say, high-tech atmosphere because we see a lot of people coming from that general high tech, from other sector in the high tech that contribute their abilities to create solution who can make better agriculture and better solution for in this term. You can put people from robotic or from AI or from machine learning, and they're getting their abilities and translate it into a better and impact agriculture.
Doron Meller, Israel Innovation Institute:Another thing just to name that we have in Israel, you can say, traditional farmers, but since Israel establish 70 years ago, we managed to do more with less. I think this is one of the abilities that build the knowledge of precision agriculture, how you can do more accurate water management, fertilizer, et cetera, and I think the Israeli farmer is more open to innovation relative to other farmer on the world, from the world.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:I have a couple questions off of that. You were talking about linking demand and supply. When you look at demand for solutions, you must be always looking globally as well, because Israel's a smaller company, so when you're working, you're looking at, how can we deploy technology globally. Is that right?
Doron Meller, Israel Innovation Institute:Yeah, exactly. As we're talking about Growing IL, we consider just the globe. A little bit of the local, but the ag tech market is globally know that we're working also with big companies. Just for example, we did a process of open innovation with Bayer Crop Science, the biggest agrochemistry company of the world.
Doron Meller, Israel Innovation Institute:They are trying to look around the Israeli ag tech different and new ideation for automation in phenotype on vegetables, for example. This is what we're trying to do. No doubt that we're trying to tackle the global challenges, yeah, the food crisis, climate change crisis, et cetera.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:When you talk about the amount of money that's been invested, is that also from VCs and firms inside Israel and outside? Where do the investment dollars come from?
Doron Meller, Israel Innovation Institute:I would say in general that we see a development in creating more VCs with focus in agri food on the world and in Israel as well, but money is invested also from a lot of foreign VCs and also from Israeli funds. Both.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:The other thing you mentioned that caught my interest was just talking about talent of being able to bring ... that you have a lot of people that are educated and schooled in high-tech disciplines and being able to recruit them into the ag tech field.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:That's certainly one of the things I think we struggle with more in the US is that a lot of people in those fields can make more money and it sounds more interesting to them to go into other high-tech areas, and they've never heard of agriculture. Why do you think in Israel that you're able to get that cross-fertilization of bringing tech people into ag?
Doron Meller, Israel Innovation Institute:First of all, I have to say honestly that in Israel, it's also a challenge. It's not that clear that everyone is coming to agritech. In the end of the day, agritech is, like you said, a little bit more risky and could be, will be less invested from some reason.
Doron Meller, Israel Innovation Institute:It's not that simple, but I think in general, I don't know if Israel is unique in that case that people from some time to time [inaudible 00:48:13] to just develop the next application, the internet side, whatsoever, and they want to do good. They want to do an influence on impactful way on the world.
Doron Meller, Israel Innovation Institute:They are looking for sectors like agri and food and maybe health, and maybe climate change, to do better, because after you make money and after you did the high-tech scene for one or two or three or five or 10 years, you are looking to make your influence better on the world. I think this is the most present reason.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:You hear different people say that here in the US, it's like, ""I don't need to design another shopping cart for another app."" How many times do you need to do that?
Doron Meller, Israel Innovation Institute:Exactly.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:That's great. How did the Institute come together?
Doron Meller, Israel Innovation Institute:I think 10 years ago, exactly 10 years ago, was one entrepreneur, his name, Leonid Bachman, he's still entrepreneur, but now he's the president of the Institute. He said, we have pretty developed high-tech scene, but in the end, the self-entrepreneur is working in his garage all alone, working all alone, and we need to see how we can make a better system to help one sector such as agritech or mobility or something to develop, and then how we can find the market failure and how we can support the one person to be more effective and create more opportunities, more companies, et cetera. This is one thing that we call ecosystem development.
Doron Meller, Israel Innovation Institute:The other thing that I think that the Institute did in the last 10 years, that working with the government on a area of impact. Let's work with the government of agriculture, let's work with the government on mobility or climate change, and let's not work with the government on internet side or another just application. Let's direct the government to bring their sources, and together, we can do impact from Israel to the world in impact sectors.
Doron Meller, Israel Innovation Institute:I think this is the most two meaningful reasons why the Institute was raised. Another thing I can say, we talk about the demand side, so in terms of Israel, one of the goals of the Institute is to make a better service pattern and to work within hospital, with public service, and we can create and help to create more innovative service or solution to the citizens, so Israel is enjoyed from innovate solution as well. This is maybe can be the third reason.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:How would you describe the ag tech ecosystem in Israel and how has it changed over the last five years? How do you see it will change over the next five years?
Doron Meller, Israel Innovation Institute:I would say that Israel is traditionally, I would say, innovative. You take companies such as Netafim bring innovative solutions, water management since the 1970s, et cetera, but they think after few decades, you can see in the last decade, maybe the last 15 years, a lot of the rise of new companies.
Doron Meller, Israel Innovation Institute:You can see a layer of 200 new startup who combine with the Israeli scene, and then you see a lot of innovative solution and new solution combined from the tech sectors to the agriculture sector and combined together to a new solution. This is one thing.
Doron Meller, Israel Innovation Institute:Another thing is you see, even though ag tech is a bit in risk comparing to other sector in high tech, you can see more and more investing in the sector. If you take the 2014 since you see around $50-million investment in the Israeli scene, and now in 2021, you can see around 480. This is another thing.
Doron Meller, Israel Innovation Institute:I think Israel in the last decade developed a lot of smart farming, precision agriculture solutions, but now, I hope to see, if you talk about the last five years, so we see a lot of dominate in the area of smart farming, a little bit of biotechnology and a little bit of supply chain, and what I really hope to see in the next five years is, first of all, in general I want to see more growth company, maybe even to dream about unicorn something like that, but to see more growth stage, more money, more people work in the ag tech general.
Doron Meller, Israel Innovation Institute:I think I want to see more solution in the, like we talk earlier about the global link, so more gene editing and resistance on probes and more solution of robotics in terms of the labor issue, which is a very big issue in agriculture, and I would say to see more sustainable agriculture.
Doron Meller, Israel Innovation Institute:It can come from alternative protein solution, plant-based, et cetera, but also from a regenerative ag and more urban agriculture, indoor agriculture, which I said relatively in this area, Israel is a little bit behind the world. I really want to see more variety in the solutions, more growth companies, and more people in the industry.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:Great. One thing that's interesting that I'm starting to see is in areas like indoor ag is that as that matures, we're starting to see more and more companies that are developing technologies to support that industry. I can imagine seeing better AI companies or better lighting companies or those water use companies, those types of things being built. It's not just people building the farms, but it's the technology that the farms will need, and that would make sense to get people working on that, too.
Doron Meller, Israel Innovation Institute:Yeah. Exactly.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:That's a wrap on my focus on Israel. Working in ag tech for so many years, I was very aware of innovative companies coming out of Israel. What I didn't realize is how many there were, and what a great ecosystem for innovation it is based on generations of doing more with less and developing close-knit communities that work with each other over lifetimes.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:This is the end of this season, and we're talking a couple weeks off. I'm taking my first flight in over a year to see my mother, then I'll be back taking on Chile, Mexico, microbial solutions, carbon and more. See you soon.

Vonnie Estes, PMA:Welcome to PMA takes on tech. The podcast that explores the problems, solutions, people, and ideas that are shaping the future of the produce industry. I'm your host Vonnie Estes. vice president of technology for the produce marketing association. And I've spent years in the ag tech sector. So, I can attest, it's hard to navigate this ever-changing world in developing and adopting new solutions to industry problems. Thanks for joining us and for allowing us to serve as your guide to the new world of produce and technology. My goal of the podcast is to outline a problem in the produce industry and then discuss several possible solutions that can be deployed today.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:Stout industrial Technology collaborates with customers to build and launch industrial technology solutions that are designed to last. The smart cultivator combines a proprietary agriculturally proven mechanical platform with Stout true vision technology to eliminate weeds and cultivate ground in a single pass visit stoutagtech.com that's, S-T-O-U-T-A-G-T-E-C-H.com to learn more. Hello today, we are changing things up and I'm the one on the other side of the microphone. This episode is a conversation I had with the modern acre recently. Listeners of this podcast will remember my interview with Tyler and Tim Nuss on regenerative ag episode 10 on December 8th.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:I was also a guest on one of their early podcasts. I love talking to Tim and Tyler about their podcast, their family farm, and growing up in the produce industry. Besides being involved with their family farm Tim works for Apeel, a PMA member focused on reducing food waste and featured in episode six. And Tyler works for Rivian an electric truck and SUV company in Southern California. You will hear some reference to me seeing an electric SUV in the wild at the end of the show. Make sure you check out the modern acre. They have nearly 170 episodes and cover a lot of topics around ag tech and they were an inspiration for me to start PMA takes on tech. Let's jump into the conversation with Tim and Tyler.
Tyler Nuss:Vonnie is a great friend of the show and it was great to have her back on. We talk a ton of different areas that we wanted to just dive in and get her perspective on. She's really an expert in the space. And so, we talked about her starting her podcast. We talk about the million- or billion-dollar question that is ag tech exits. And so she really gives an overview of what specs and why they're getting so popular. And they're so hot right now in the space and the companies that are choosing to exit and IPO via SPAC.
Tyler Nuss:We also get into carbon markets and just the emphasis on carbon with the regenerative agriculture movement. So, we hit on all the fun stuff today guys. And Vonnie, I think, brings a ton of great insights into it. And we finished this show, talking a little bit about her seeing a Rivian in the wild. So, it's pretty fun as well, but without further ado, let's jump in. Bonnie. It's great to have you back on the podcast. We've built a relationship over the years we've been on your podcast. Want to start there, since we talked to you last on our podcasts, you've started your own. So, want to just talk about how that's been for you, what it was like starting, starting a podcast for you and what you've learned so far.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:Thanks so much for having me on. You guys were an inspiration to me. And I think we started the podcast last June and it's called PMA takes on tech. And my idea was, especially during COVID, since I couldn't go out and talk to members or travel that I would start, this was a way to continue conversations that I wanted to keep having during COVID. And so we started last June and it was... I was a consumer of podcasts. Your podcast was the first one I listened to in the ag space. And I thought, well, I'll just give this a shot. And we had no idea if it was going to work or not like who is going to listen to this and all the learnings of buying the right microphone and all the things that come with it. But we just dropped today our 20th episode.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:So we've done 20 and we are in spitting distance of a hundred thousand listeners, which is really exciting. It's quite amazing that we've gotten that many people to listen to it. And the format that I use is usually bring in someone to talk about a problem or a region overall. And then I bring in two or three companies to talk about solutions. And I've recently been doing a lot of work in other regions outside of North America, which has been fun for me since I can't travel, but it's really, I've learned things I hadn't expected and, and looking at these different regions. But yeah, it's really been a great thing to work on and I've really enjoyed it. And just love that I have a following and thanks you guys for being my inspiration.
Tim Nuss:That's been really fun watching you kick that off and listening. It's a big milestone to hit 20 episodes. It's a lot of work as I'm sure you're realizing, but it's cool to see you going down that path. And I think a really opportune time to get into this space with COVID and the lack of travel in a way to educate yourself, which is something that Tyler and I find super rewarding with the podcast is just talking to really smart people and learning about what's going on in the space.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:Yeah, definitely. And I think working, I'm right now working on a Singapore episode and Israel episode and a Chile episode. And at this point really talking about how these ecosystems are developing and these other areas. And I wouldn't have asked the question that way. I've done also one in Brazil and Australia, but it's just how I'm thinking about during COVID and doing the podcasts of framing the question of like, what are the ecosystems in these different regions? How are these companies formed? How do they think about going global? In Singapore, if you develop a company and you get investment, you better have your eye globally because it's a pretty small country. So it's been really interesting just to hear about new technologies and how they're being started in other places.
Tim Nuss:Yeah. I think that's super important. To keep the global lens not just focus solely on us companies. I think there's a lot of innovation like you're saying, out of Singapore where it's really centralized a lot of ag tech popping up there in the middle east and getting the holistic lens on what's happening. Well, Vonnie, we'd like to talk about something that's top of mind for us. We saw in the news recently that PMA and the United Fresh announced a merger. Can you give us any insights into the merger?
Vonnie Estes, PMA:Yeah, sure. So I'm sure most of your produce industry listeners are aware of the PMA and United Fresh coming together to form one company. And that will start next year, January 1st, next year. And so both organizations will continue to run as they've been running this year. But we're really excited about the groups coming together. And many people have watched this over the years and thought this would be a good idea. I'm forming this new global trade association to serve the industry with the strengths of both organizations. So there's a transition team in place to make it all happen. So stay tuned and see how this all unfolds. And both organizations will continue to have their events that they planned for this year. And the new organization will form at the beginning of next year.
Tyler Nuss:Awesome. No, really appreciate that update and definitely really exciting, I think, for the industry. And it'll be awesome to follow just that transition. It's definitely a big undertaking, but I'm sure it will be a lot of exciting stuff in the future. So we'll stay tuned for that. Vonnie want to dive into a few different topics that we've chatted about on the podcast. Want to get your take, obviously being in the produce industry and focusing on ag tech. One thing that obviously we talked a lot about in the podcast is regenerative agriculture and the focus on soil health and how that relates to sequestering carbon. So I know there's been just a ton of discussion on podcasts on big news publications. There's a lot of headlines surrounding carbon markets and especially with the new administration, there's been a lot of talks on about that. So we're just left to park here for a few minutes and talk about your thoughts about carbon markets and the emphasis and focus on regenerative ag.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:Yeah, it's been really amazing. I mean, throughout my career, there's been a couple of big ideas or big things that have happened that have turned everybody and focus everybody's attention. And one of those early on in my career was genetic modification. And I got very involved in that at an early stage. Another one was biofuels and the biofuels industry, and there's a lot of learnings from that in this case, I think. And then I've worked more recently on gene editing and some of those technologies. And so this is another one where suddenly everybody's talking about it. And I think part of it is because of the change in administration and suddenly we're paying a lot more attention to climate and climate change. And then that's brought into looking at how do we sequester more carbon. So I think from an overview, there's just a lot of different forces.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:We've got companies, we've got the government paying attention to it and starting to put money into it. We've got companies the major food and ag companies like Cargill and General Mills and some of the other big companies. They're saying we really want to talk about carbon friendly practices and regenerative ag. And then we've got consumers now saying, ""We're really interested in you showing us that the way that you're growing and that this is good for the environment and that's the kind of food I want to eat."" So I think what makes this moment different is that we've got all of those different interests of people saying, ""Yes, we want this and we want it now."" And then the rest of the market and this whole system is floundering saying, ""Well, how do we deliver this? This is really complicated. And we're not even sure how to measure carbon in the soil. And over what period of time?""
Vonnie Estes, PMA:And so I think it's really fascinating to look at how do we build the system and not. How do we just get a bunch of tools and stack the tools together, but how do we develop the system where producers don't take all the risks producers actually get paid and get rewarded and get supported for sequestering carbon. And that there are tools that are easy to use and that are verifiable. And that there's a system to sell the carbon credits and that's set up and there's a system to buy the carbon credits in that set up. And so that whole system needs to be put into place. And right now it's just a bunch of moving pieces that I think is confusing a lot of people.
Tim Nuss:Yeah. It's a super interesting space. It still feels very early. Almost like the wild west where you read about these deals. Where it's hundreds of thousands of dollars for carbon credits. And I think the industry is going to mature here quite a bit. Tyler and I get asked about it quite a bit on the farm. Are we into carbon markets? And we've poked around a little bit, but we still haven't found anything for our particular size and scope of our operation that makes sense. We've talked to a few and in a lot of cases, just the cost to process the transaction is more than the value of the credit itself. So for us personally, I think we're viewing it as a nice to have. We're not building into our 2021 budget or next year's budget. But I think we're hoping that in the future that becomes a part and a potential revenue stream to supplement what we're doing with our actual crop revenue.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:Are you having people approach you saying that they want to buy credits for you or they want to help you set up a way to measure? Are they coming to you and starting to offering you different systems?
Tim Nuss:Not yet. We've reached out to a couple companies that you see that are popping up in this space us reaching out to them. We haven't really put ourselves out there as far as opening ourselves up to it. I'm not sure if there's a marketplace that exists like that. But I think that could be interesting where farmers that are interested and you can almost start collecting a database of who's interested, who's doing what to understand the addressable market.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:Oh, that's a great idea. It's a good business motto.
Tyler Nuss:Hey, it's for sale guys. Anyone listening, hey, if you want to, if you want to approach us we'll figure out a deal. Don't worry.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:Yeah. I think especially in the produce industry is, like you all are, people aren't really approaching us as much yet as they are corn and soy and then the more broad acre crops. But when you look at it, the crops that you guys grow, there's a lot of carbon in those roots. And so I think really thinking about the produce industry and how we can make this be a positive for people doing what they're already doing or making minor changes. And so I think it'll be really interesting to see how it plays out.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:But I really see it as, they'll start being some really good pilot programs. And I think putting some government money into is good and some incentives is good and the government has to be involved to get this nascent industry off the ground a little bit but not set it up with a bunch of subsidies and not set it up with a bunch of unrealistic expectations and not have the government pick winners and losers, but just enable the market. But I think it's going to be at least five years before we really have something that that's working throughout the whole system.
Tyler Nuss:Yeah. I think that's a really good point. One thing I think is important is just the technology. Right? I mean, I think most of these programs or companies are using the comment system, which has a lot of flaws. It's really clunky and it's based on a lot of assumptions. Right? So there's got to be a balance. And I think it's going to happen over the next few years, like you said, of the technology to actually measure this stuff, because I think that'll be a really critical piece of it.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:Yeah. How do you measure it? How do you verify it? How long? How permanent does it need to be? I think there's a lot of questions there that we just... And then making sure that we're measuring the right thing and what we're doing is really good for the soil and good for the environment. I think you started off this piece, talking about regenerative ag and I think that's such an important part of it is... Yeah. Let's not all focus so much on carbon in the soil, but let's make sure that we're doing practices that actually are better for the soil better for the land and better for the food that we're producing.
Tyler Nuss:Absolutely. Yeah, definitely really interesting space. We'll be obviously following very closely with what happens in carbon markets and regenerative. But Vonnie want to want to switch gears here and talk about ag tech exits and introductions to the market. So I think this has been a really common theme or question within the ag tech industry over the past five, 10 plus years of, what our exits going to look like? And we've seen a few recent companies going public via specs, as well as a few other exits in the space. So just want to get your perspective on what you're seeing the industry is trending towards right now.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:Yeah. This is so exciting. I'm so excited about this. It's like exits, we're really having exits. And I remember when I first started working and what we started calling ag tech six, eight years ago. And I got asked to speak on a number of panels where people were saying, ""Okay, is ag tech, the new clean tech, and is it going to completely fail?"" And money was really nervous about, do we really want to invest in this and is this real? And then in 2017 we had blue river and granular we're two pretty good exits. Pretty positive for the companies. That's 2017. And I don't know if that there's been anything big since then. We still hold on whenever anyone says, ""Well, what are the... Oh, there's granular and blue river."" But that was 2017.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:So I'm so excited this year that there's so much going on and SPACs has been, they've been amazing. And I'll just briefly, I'm sure most people know what they are, but there's special purpose acquisition companies. And they're created to raise money that will be used to take a private company public through a merger at a future date. So it's a new way of raising money and it's a little less risky for the company. And I know a number of companies have gone through this. They say, ""Okay, if I do another raise, if I do my series D and I raise $400 million, what's my valuation going to be? Or do I do a SPAC and go public and get a much better valuation.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:And so I think that's why a number of companies, both in our sector and other sectors are saying, ""This is amazing. Let's go to market this way because it makes more sense. In my house my husband works for 23andMe and they just announced that they're doing a SPAC. So we're pretty excited about that as well. So it's happening. And it really brings in a number of different people that invest and a different way to go to market than has happened in the past. So there's been 306 SPACs that have gone public in all sectors this calendar year. And sometimes this is a better way of going, an ag may be part of this because the investors in SPACs are looking for more high growth and significant more long-term potential. And so that's pretty exciting. So it's a little background on SPACs.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:And so app harvest was the first one in our sector that did a SPAC and they got $435 million in unrestricted cash from that. And so what they're going to do with that, they say, is just build more farms and it's a great infusion of cash for them to really be able to expand. And then the second one that we've seen is AeroFarms and their public offering, they're going to be valued at $1.2 billion and their IPO will close it the quarter two of this year. And that will leave the merged entity with over $300 million of unrestricted cash at close. And so AeroFarms again, will have this cash that they can use to expand, which is super cool. So those are the two SPACs that have happened. And then UpHarvest turned around and bought a Root AI. And so that's a great exit for the investors that people in Root AI. So that's another example of what's happening with the maturation of the market.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:Farmer's Edge went public on the Canadian stock exchange. And so that's another great IPO of a company going forward. There's been some smaller companies that have come together, mergers like Flora Stat, and there's been some other exits of those types. So it really is this interesting maturation of the market. That's so exciting to watch, and it will bring more money to the market as investors see that, yes, we can invest in this space and we can get out and we can make money. I think we'll see more companies going public. This isn't based on inside information at all, but I wouldn't be surprised to see Plenty go public and Impossible foods has already said that they're looking at going public. So I think it's a great time for the industry. I'm super excited about it.
Tim Nuss:Yeah. It's a super fun time in this space. It's like the saying, ""Everything happens slowly then all at once."" And it seems like everything's happening all at once in Q1 of 2021.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:Yeah. While we're all sitting around staring at our computer screens. It's pretty amazing.
Tim Nuss:It's been pretty cool. Well, the companies that you mentioned, Vonnie, UpHarvest, AeroFarms, Plenty, that you mentioned, all the common theme is that they're indoor farming companies. Anything that you think is unique about indoor farming and why now that all this money is being raised?
Vonnie Estes, PMA:Yeah. I think it is pretty exciting that this has really caught hold. Especially at a time when it's still hard to show, given some of the high energy costs that we're going to make a lot of money in the U S with these types of farms. But I think they're driving costs down. A lot of the costs are going down with the inputs for indoor. And I think there's a number of things. I think the whole sustainability story around indoor that you're using less, you have to use a lot less crop protection products. They're using a lot less water. The footprint is a lot smaller. So I think that whole story of around sustainability for that sector, and also not having to transport product as far, because you can locate closer to markets. So I think that story is playing really well of investors and has really grabbed people's attention.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:I think for the PMA members that are in Salinas and then other areas where we're growing a lot of leafy greens outside, I think that's still is a really important part of the market. And I think what the indoor ag growers are doing or are growing the market. They're making the pie bigger. So it's not taking anything away from those that are growing outside. And I also think a lot of the technology that's being developed indoor because the cycle times are fast. And because we're putting these really brilliant computer scientists in there to study how plants grow. I think there's going to be a lot of learnings that we're going to get. And a lot of breeding we're going to be able to do, that we're going to be able to apply to outside as well.
Tyler Nuss:Yeah. That's really interesting. Taking those learnings where the money's invested there and bringing it outside, I think is really interesting prospects. Yeah. And I think in general, I'm super curious to see how the indoor farming, vertical farming movement compares to the regenerative ag movement and focusing on the soil. Right? And so I think it's going to be to two parallel movements to keep an eye on, for sure.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:Yeah. I think they can certainly co-exist and people can love them both.
Tyler Nuss:Yeah. And I think that's what Tim and I have long discussed. I think there's different use cases and I think there's not necessarily a right answer. I think there's there's room for innovation and different techniques and approaches within the space. And it's going to take a lot of work across the industry to push each other. Right? And where maybe indoor falls in some areas maybe regenerative falls short in other areas. Right? So I think it's going to be important to have that competition and innovation in these different approaches.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:Yeah. And it'll be interesting to see what happens with Indoor beyond leafy greens. I know Plenty has been talking about their work they're doing with Driscolls and developing strawberries and other UpHarvest is greenhouse not vertical but they're doing mostly tomatoes and other crops. And so it'll be interesting to see how that grows and what other crops we can get into. And I think also overseas in areas that it may be harder to grow outside. How is that going to take off? As I mentioned, I've been talking to people in Singapore this week and it's a real push in Singapore. They import 90% of their food. And with the supply chains disruptions this year, they started thinking how do we really push forward and getting more food produced in Singapore if there's a larger supply chain disruption. And so they have a plan 30 by 30, which has produced 30% of the food that they eat by 2030. And so I think looking at other areas where vertical farms may be a better solution for lots of different reasons. Totally
Tim Nuss:Well, Vonnie, as we start to wrap up here, what companies or trends are you following right now that you're most excited about?
Vonnie Estes, PMA:So I think this goes with my trend when I was talking about exits and maturation of the industry. And what I like seeing is a lot of the companies that are starting to support these bigger trends. And I sit on this board of a group it's called IN2 and it's, NREL the national renewable energy lab in Colorado and the Danforth center in St. Louis and Wells Fargo came together and work with really early stage companies to just help support them. Both do the science, either at NREL or at the Danforth center and also with some funding to help them get going. And so we just finished up a program with them where it was all about indoor ag technology. So I think they started, I don't know how many applications they got, but they narrowed it down to 33.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:And then we had to narrow, we the people on the board had to narrow it down to five. And it's typical pitch day where you sit there and listen to 10 pitches. But it was really fascinating to see all these different companies that are looking at different kinds of lighting and different kinds of water and systems and different kinds of breeding. And so I'm really seeing this maturation that we're starting to have companies develop and come up that are supporting the big trends like indoor ag. I think the, I'm always going to talk about genetics. But I think what's happening in breeding is really exciting when you've got a lot of companies like Pairwise and Vincent Hill and companies like this that are looking at using new breeding techniques and supporting the industry with new germplasm and new types of traits.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:And I talked a startup company yesterday, which is coming out of the indie bio accelerator, and they've got a really interesting technology that's on the very front end of that to help people figure out genotype to phenotype. So do that very first step faster. And so two young guys that are looking at that differently. And so I love that we're starting to see just these supporting types of industries. One other one is around, I know you guys have talked a lot about around robotics and augmentation. And I think a number of the half step solutions, like burrow and some of those which are, get these little robots out in the field now. Get them working now. And then we'll get into the big, gigantic ones that are a little harder. But I love seeing that we're really getting things out that are being used.
Tyler Nuss:That overview. And I think you're spot on. It's a lot of the infrastructure, the supporting spaces that I think is going to be where a lot of value is created. And hopefully a much of that value is going to the farmer. But I love that overview. Vonnie, this has been a ton of fun. We really appreciate your insight. You're always a wealth of knowledge. As we finish up I just want to ask, what was it like to see a Rivian in the wild? It sounds like you saw Rivian doing some on-street tests.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:This was so cool. So I was walking down the dog park with my two dogs and I saw it and I was like, ""Oh my gosh that's so cool. What is that?"" And then I went up and I saw what it was, and it was the paint job was amazing. The whole... It was just amazing. But there was no one around. Yeah. And so I was just standing around and then I was walking back from the dog park and there was a guy and his dog and there's four people standing around. And so I let my dogs drift over so I could start the conversation.
Tyler Nuss:Yeah. Very casual.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:Very casual. And then like, ""Those aren't even out yet. How do you even have this vehicle?"" And so he was opening the door and show me the inside of it. And it was just-
Tyler Nuss:Oh, that's awesome.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:Yeah. It was so cool. And he didn't tell me the name of the company, I'm sure you know. But they said they designed the software and you're in Palo Alto. And so it was just this really amazing Menlo park moment where like the dogs were talking to each other and I'm looking at this car that isn't even really out on the street in many places yet. So I was psyched.
Tyler Nuss:That's pretty awesome. I have not seen one in the wild yet. One of the test vehicles. So yeah, we're getting super close to launch them to the public. Definitely really exciting time for, for us as a company this year is going to be quite the adventure.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:Yeah. Good luck with that. It was... I felt privileged. It's only because, well, they were asking me like how I knew about it. They're like, ""How do you know so much? Because I was asking them about the customer service were you were saying that every vehicle goes out is going to have their own customer service person. And so I just knew way too much. How do you know so much? And so I mentioned you and it was just a very exciting moment. So yeah.
Tyler Nuss:That's awesome. Well, Vonnie, thank you so much for the time. We really appreciate it. Thanks for being on.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:Yeah. Great to be here.
Tim Nuss:So Tye, what do you think?
Tyler Nuss:We got to talk about all the fun stuff today. So that was really fun. I loved Vonnie's take. One thing I learned was, I've had a negative connotation towards SPAC stem. The connotation I have is, it's for companies that maybe aren't prepared to go the traditional IPO route. And so to get her perspective on actually a lot of the advantages of it, even from the company's perspective and the employee's perspective I think was, was really important. And I think they could fill a huge need within the industry. Especially in ag tech where historically it has been hard to go the path of IPO. So I think there's probably a lot of really strong companies that SPACs may be a fit for. But time will tell about if this whole spec model is really here to stay or if we're going to see a bubble.
Tim Nuss:Yeah. I had a pretty similar takeaway. I thought that was an interesting perspective looking at it from, from both sides. And I think with the Coinbase IPO, that was a direct listing. I think there's a lot of nuance in how companies go public. And a lot of implications for existing shareholders, stockholders investors on what that means in the route they use to go public. So I think we'll probably see more of these creative ways to go public in the future.
Tyler Nuss:We'll hope you guys enjoyed that. That was a lot of fun to just hit on some of our favorite hot button issues right now, carbon markets, regenerative ag, indoor ag. And so that was a lot of fun with Vonnie.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:What a fun conversation. I hope that was interesting for my listeners to hear some of my background and thoughts on current hot topics. Please let me know if there are other topics you would like me to touch on in future episodes. I'm going to continue doing regional episodes. I have part two ready on Israel and I'm setting up focus episodes on Chile and Mexico. I'm also planning an episode on Floral and then of course taking my turn, talking about carbon.

Vonnie Estes, PMA:Welcome to PMA takes on technology. The podcast that explores the problems, solutions, people and ideas that are shaping the future of the produce industry. I'm your host, Vonnie Estes, vice president of technology for the Produce Marketing Association. And I've spent years in the agtech sector. So I can attest, it's hard to navigate this ever changing world and developing and adopting new solutions to industry problems. Thanks for joining us and for allowing us to serve as your guide to the new world of produce and technology. My goal of the podcast is to outline a problem in the produce industry and then discuss several possible solutions that can be deployed today. Stout Industrial Technology collaborates with customers to build and launch industrial technology solutions that are designed to last. The smart cultivator combines a proprietary agriculturally proven mechanical platform with Stout True Vision technology to eliminate weeds and cultivate ground in a single pass.

Vonnie Estes, PMA:Welcome to this episode on agtech in Israel. I've been doing these episodes based in different regions. I've done them for Brazil, South Africa, Australia and last week, Singapore. It varies how difficult it is to get the right people on Zoom and produce an episode. It mostly depends on my relationship with people. If I don't know people very well or at all, it can take up to three months to get three to four speakers. Well, Israel broke the mold on that. I know a few of the speakers from prior work and they got back to me right away and everyone had a suggestion of other people who should be on the podcast. So suddenly I had eight people. Unless you are Tim Ferriss, no one is going to sit through a two hour podcast. So I decided to do two episodes on Israel.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:I think this can be attributed to both the amount of agtech coming out of Israel, that everyone knows everyone else due to the size of the country and just how outgoing and willing to talk people are in Israeli agtech. So get ready for an exciting episode about an exciting region. Israel has long been famous for growing food in the desert and inventing cherry tomatoes. Its current agricultural achievements are no less than precedent. And dozens of innovative agtech and now food tech startups are developing innovative solutions for the world. Precisely because Israel is a small country with relatively few natural resources of its own it has stressed the development of forward thinking highly advanced agricultural solutions. In this episode, we will hear from a great variety of experience and technologies.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:First, Oded Distel will talk about his time at the Ministry of the Economy and Industry and also his new startup with a solution for water shortages. Oded gives a great overview of how government helps the growth and success of the agtech sector in Israel. We will also hear from Ohad Zuckerman, managing director at COPIA Agro and Food Technologies Fund. After Ohad, we will hear from two companies with great solutions for the produce industry. So let's get started with the conversations. We have with us Oded, and I want to talk to you about your company. But also I want to talk to you about your time with the Ministry of Economy and Industry. So you got a very long career both on the commercial side and also on the government side so you're uniquely positioned to talk about what's happened in Israel in technology and in agriculture. So why don't you start just telling us a little bit about yourself and your background?
Oded Distel, Tal-Ya Agriculture Solutions:Sure. So first, pleasure being here with you here today. I'm a follower of the podcast and a great pleasure to be talking to you today. So as you said, I had a long career in the Israeli government, seeing things from a macro point of view, looking at the industries, water industry, the agro industry from that perspective. And recently about a year and a half ago I left the government after 23 years there, moved to the private sector and I'm the CEO now of a Tal-Ya, small agro company. The transition is fascinating, looking at things from a totally different point of view now. And I like it, makes my life interesting.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:Great. Yeah, that is different. The different types of things that are necessary to run a commercial company. So in this episode I'm focusing on agro technology development in Israel and how the ecosystem has evolved. From your background it looks like you've had a big hand in developing ecosystem through bringing foreign investors and support from the multinationals. So please talk to us about your work at the Ministry and how that's helped agtech.
Oded Distel, Tal-Ya Agriculture Solutions:Yeah, so when you talk about the technology, so what you really think about the tech side. You serve good stuff, algorithms, automation, and on and on and on. And usually people ignore the fact that in order to bring a technology to full implementation to the market, it takes a huge effort from the entire ecosystem to work together and to want to make it happen. And the ecosystem concept means that we work together with all the different players, the government, the regulators, the investors, the academia, startups, NGOs, obviously farmers, water, utilities and on and on, and try to bridge the gaps between all those different players, which is a relatively a very tough challenge. In Israel we have a lot of things that play in our favor. One obviously, the place is small.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:Yeah.
Oded Distel, Tal-Ya Agriculture Solutions:So it's really easy to get around and to interact and to meet the people almost on a daily basis. If my office was in Jerusalem, at the ministry, but I could be there in the morning and then go to Tel Aviv for a meeting and end up in Jerusalem back in the evening for a meet up. And same goes with Beersheba and Haifa, and the entire country is in a distance of a few hours of driving. Which means that you are able at the end of the day to say, okay, I know the ecosystem, meaning I know the people, not something theoretically.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:Yeah.
Oded Distel, Tal-Ya Agriculture Solutions:I have everybody on my iPhone. It's figured out to almost all the CEOs of the companies and the main researchers in the academia, and I can ask questions and get answers immediately and connect the dots in no time. Which I think is pretty different to a large country like the US or even a medium sized country or relatively big compared to Israel like Italy or France or whatever. Second is the local culture in Israel, which a people tend to interact a lot. Relatively warm open culture and we have a lot of opportunities to interact as well. So there is the army service that everybody mingles together, university. So the ability to bridge those gaps between the groups is much easier in Israel compared to other places.
Oded Distel, Tal-Ya Agriculture Solutions:And eventually the fact that we didn't have any other choice. We had to come up with solutions to those challenges because we simply could not do otherwise. So we had to come up to solutions to water challenges, we had to grow food in the desert, we had to come up with processes that would allow us to do much more with less resources. So all those combinations together created a very dynamic society and culture that pushes forward on those concepts of fair innovation, of fair thinking out of the box, of trying to do something fail and try again until you make it. So I would say the combination of all those elements together created this interesting place that brings a lot of innovation in agriculture, in water, in medical, in cyber, in whatever.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:So a lot of the things that are developed in Israel, like you said, it is a small country and you do have a lot of agriculture there but it's not a big country. So when companies are formed, do they form with the idea that they're going to need to go global, that they'll need to be global companies? Is that in the thinking of the formation?
Oded Distel, Tal-Ya Agriculture Solutions:Sure, from day one. And sometimes people exaggerate because they start a company and the two founders would argue if they want to go IPO in Chile and in London. They didn't do anything yet, but they find something to argue about. So the answer to that is definitely yes. Everybody looks at the local market as a testbed, as a final place, play around in the sandbox and at a very relatively very early stage, move globally. Obviously, the fact that the world is so close now, even the time of corona, you could be in a conference in the morning in India and then end up in somewhere in Chile afterwards with Zoom call. And it's quite a common in Israeli culture for some time now to be very globally, to interact with the different cultures, languages, people from all over the world. So the long answer to say, big yes.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:And with the financing, I mean, I know a number of the agtech VC companies that are here in the States have made investments in Israeli companies even very early stage. And is that normal? Does the financing often come from outside the country or do you have a lot of venture capitalists and private money that goes into companies in Israel or both?
Oded Distel, Tal-Ya Agriculture Solutions:So the VC industry in Israel started somewhere in the '90s. It's a very interesting story because it's one of those cases where the government did something positive.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:Yay.
Oded Distel, Tal-Ya Agriculture Solutions:Yeah. And we keep coming back to this story, is very happy with it. So somewhere in the early '90s the government identified that there're a lot of startups and entrepreneurs. And that the lack of financial resources is the main obstacle that prevent them from growing. And the government initiated a program where it said, that the private sector we'll put a bucket of money, you put a bucket of money, you manage the investment and in some time we the government will give you the private sector the option to buy us out, buy them out. And then the startup. So in the beginning, five small VCs that were a partially owned by the government but the private sector was the one to manage it. To make the long story short, it was a huge success. At a certain point the private sector bought out the government and the VC industry went on from that point, going very fast forward.
Oded Distel, Tal-Ya Agriculture Solutions:So at the presence the VC industry in Israel is local VCs, foreign VC is represented in Israel, Israeli VCs that raise money from abroad, mostly US, Canada but recently also a lot of money is coming from Asia, China, India, Japan, et cetera. And obviously the recent trend is a lot of interest from the Gulf, from the United Arab Emirates that we see and also Europe, not to forget Europe. So it's a very competitive, interesting market. And you'll hear different things. From the point of view of the startups, you'll hear that the VCs are very conservative and they don't take risk and they don't invest enough and they just look for the easy investments and they don't go to very early stage, et cetera. From the VC side you'll hear, not enough options, not enough companies and on and on. But I assume it's the same discussion you hear in the Silicon Valley and you hear in London and in all those centers of innovation. And usually it's a game. Sometimes you have a lot of a competition over the money and sometimes the money is competing over full startups.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:Interesting. So what do you think that the ecosystem needs to continue and grow and prosper in Israel? Is there anything, it sounds like you got money coming in from a lot of different places, you've got government support, is there anything missing or anything you'd like to see different to keep things growing as fast as it has been?
Oded Distel, Tal-Ya Agriculture Solutions:So, the government also has an important role. And the government has to interfere, not interfere, but to be a partner where I would say the other different players would see a more narrow point of view, more narrow angle. And the government has to have a broader perspective of things. And in a way this is what I did when I was in the ministry, we have created or we have fostered this ecosystem around the water technologies. And the same concept was then implemented in other sectors including agriculture. So I'm a very strong advocate for this concept of working in ecosystem and providing the opportunities for the entrepreneurs to interact with regulators. And it is fascinating because you realize that they speak different languages.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:Mm-hmm (affirmative). They can end up talking past each other, right?
Oded Distel, Tal-Ya Agriculture Solutions:Amazing, amazing. We have a meter and we called it regulator on the bar. We brought the important regulators from the water authority, from the Ministry of Health, Minister of Environment, to meet Israeli water startups. And at a certain point I realized that I need to interfere and translate the language to the regulator and the language of the entrepreneurs because they did not speak the same language. Obviously they speak Hebrew, but it was not the same language.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:Yeah.
Oded Distel, Tal-Ya Agriculture Solutions:So if you give the regulator the only opportunity to meet a startup when they have to take a very bold decision to allow a new cool technology to enter the market, and they have tons of responsibility on their shoulders and they have to take it upon themselves, the chances that they're going to be strong enough to take a courageous decision is not big. But if they have met the entrepreneur a year before and they have interacted with him, and maybe they went to see a small pilot that the guy had in the university and they've built confidence and they've built a trust relation, the chances that at a certain point this guy might say, okay, I feel that I'm on the safe ground. I can take a little bit more risks with this technology, is much greater. And in a way this is the idea.
Oded Distel, Tal-Ya Agriculture Solutions:Same goes with investors and with NGOs, to be able to connect all those players. And going back to your question, what is in a way missing now? So the fact that so many sectors are now competing over specific capabilities or specific talents, it has to do a lot with data and data scientific enom, makes those people being torn in different sectors. The financial sector wants them at the health sector, agriculture, transportation, energy and on and on. So the idea is how do we open the door and let a lot of new talent and people from other sectors that were not yet in the game until recently. In the Israeli case it would be the Arab community in the ultra orthodox, and let those guys come in and play in this wonderful field that we all like so much.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:Yeah, I think that's true for the United States as well. Is that sometimes agriculture isn't the most exciting in people's minds if they didn't grow up around it. And so, how do you get talent both people who live in the US and how do we bring people from other places? Because we have a shortage of that talent as well because there's so much need in the area. So let's switch a little bit to your company. And as you've mentioned several times, water scarcity is a very big issue in Israel and becoming more so worldwide. And so what attracted you to go into the private sector and tell us about the company and your product?
Oded Distel, Tal-Ya Agriculture Solutions:So after 23 years in the government, which was fascinating, right. As I told you, I did something that I felt like I had a startup inside the government, which is totally a crazy thing. But it was really inspiring and challenging and very interesting. True. And then at a certain point I said, okay, enough, I want to do something different, I want to do something totally different. And then from my position I knew almost everybody in the water, in agriculture, in energy. And there was this small company that I knew for some years that I was totally in love with the technology. And it was still at the stage where it was a big promise, but did not yet deliver. And then I said, okay, this is the mission. This is something I want to take forward, to take a very small company with a very simple technology. I mean, Tal-Ya, what we do, we create ideal microclimate to the root zone of young trees. And by the way, the product we call it Mitra, which is wound in Greek.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:Wow.
Oded Distel, Tal-Ya Agriculture Solutions:Yeah. And this is the way and this is exactly the way we look at what we do to those a very young trees. We are like a mother taking care of very young babies. So the challenge here is, the technology works. Agronomically we know it works, we tested it. And the beauty of it is that it works in a holistic way. It saves water, it prevent weeds, it mitigates extreme weather conditions, it protects the soil, it takes care of soil health, soil erosion, and on and on. So we're doing all this beautiful staff in an extreme extremely simple way because we work with nature or nature works with us, it's a partnership. So this is the journey that I choose to take after leaving the government. So from this huge big very bureaucratic monstrous organization, all the way to something extremely small. Yeah, and this is a challenge and I love it.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:It's fascinating. I looked on your website and there's a video that shows. And it's very infrequent that you see a video that really without words it completely explains the product and how it works. And so that's really well done and really shows what the product can do. What geographies are you in right now and kind of what's the state of rolling this product out?
Oded Distel, Tal-Ya Agriculture Solutions:Great. So in agriculture as you know made better than myself, things takes time. So it is a slow process to introduce a new product to the market. So we are working in India, and in India we have collaboration and partnership with their very strong local players. So it is a Tata Trust and Tata Coffee and Syngenta Foundation. And those organizations are aiming at improving dramatically the smallholders segment and increase their income. And because Tal-Ya and the Mitras are a very modern, meaning we can be implemented in an extremely large orchard in California or Australia. And we are totally relevant for a small holder with maybe one acre behind his house. So, we work in India and we had some extremely nice pilots there drawing tomatoes and some kind of Hanuka zucchini, Indian zucchini, with wonderful results and we're now moving to the next stage. We have a very nice pilot in New Mexico with the New Mexico State University with-
Vonnie Estes, PMA:That's where I went to school.
Oded Distel, Tal-Ya Agriculture Solutions:Nice. Wonderful people and such a joy working with them. Professor Manoj Shukla is running the spiral. So it is with the countries and we learned that the pecans are a great place in the local economy in New Mexico and at the same time they have a very serious issue with water shortage.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:Mm-hmm (affirmative).
Oded Distel, Tal-Ya Agriculture Solutions:Take a lot of water. So the promise that we make is very attractive. The only problem again, it's going to take time to get results. So there's New Mexico, we are working in Mexico and in Australia with wine yards. So yeah, different geographics. We are looking for the situations stuff. Where things are tough, then our contribution is significant.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:Great to hear that broad perspective of what is happening in Israel. Now we will move to hear how investing is working in Israel at COPIA Agro and Food Technologies Fund with Ohad Zuckerman. COPIA invests in agricultural and food technology projects in Israeli R&D institutes and by hands on management and in cooperation with strategic partners that bring them to maturity. COPIA has several interesting business models on getting technology to market quickly and less costly. Ohad has a great background in management and international business with a long career in ag and food which gives him a great eye as to what they should invest in and develop. Please tell us about yourself, your background and COPIA Agro and Food Technologies Fund.
Ohad Zuckerman, COPIA Agro& Food Technologies Fund:Sure. So I'm 57 soon in July. And COPIA is my third career. I started working in a family company, seed family company that my father founded back in the '50s. It's called the Zeraim Gedera. It was actually purchased, acquired first by a fund, a private equity fund in Israel and then by Syngenta. It's now part of Syngenta. Then I moved to aquaculture. And I initiated a company that deals with micro algae. Today the company has a face mask for micro algae and it's starting to do all the commercialization. And COPIA is my third and hopefully last career. This is really an amazing fund. We have a great achievement so far. I meet amazing people every day. I'm an agronomist by profession and I have a business degree, a joint degree from Tel Aviv University and the Kellogg School of Business from Northwestern. And actually these two things of agriculture and food and business come together in COPIA. And the good thing about COPIA is that it's not just making money, it's really an impact funded to also try to do something good with the money.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:So what is being an impact fund mean to you? How do you act differently than if you weren't an impact fund and how does that color your investments and how you look at different businesses?
Ohad Zuckerman, COPIA Agro& Food Technologies Fund:Okay. So first of all, COPIA invest in agriculture and food technologies that do something good to the food supply chain, from the genetics to the plate. We're trying to improve the sustainability by mitigation of climate change and food safety and food security. And so all our technologies are doing something that either changes from chemicals to biologicals or improving the processes of the food production or improving the shelf life and the quality of food and things like that. And we talk not about the fruits and vegetables, but also livestock welfare for example and about fish production. So we are really involved in all aspects of food. And the impact is really to increase sustainability by replacing a product or enhancing processes and enhancing of course yields and productivity. Another thing as an impact fund, at least I think it's very interesting, doesn't need to do anything with technologies. We invest in two main avenues.
Ohad Zuckerman, COPIA Agro& Food Technologies Fund:The main avenue that we invest in is in technologies originating from Israeli research organizations and universities. We find technologies that have passed the proof of concept stage, we teamed up with companies from the relevant verticals and we transform these technologies into products that could be sold or process that could implement and improve sustainability. And of course, this is done in a very serious way. We create a team between us, the research team and the research organization or university and the company that is doing the development and commercialization later on. So we finance the research part, the companies do the income investment by funding all the development of commercialization. In addition to that we also invest in startups. And the startups are all more into development than research, but they complete our portfolio. So that's one thing that we do from the impact point of view.
Ohad Zuckerman, COPIA Agro& Food Technologies Fund:Another thing which is very interesting, if you look at the technologies in which we invest in research institutions, about 60, 65% of the technologies are led by women researchers. However when you go to the startup world is completely ruled by men, 99%. So people talk about gender equality, and this is something that I personally believe that gender equality in life will come from gender equality in business. So this is already now the second year that COPIA initiate and manages a competition for women entrepreneurs in agriculture and food. And the second competition is going to take place on June 6th, it's going to be live in the internet as well. And I think this is another aspect of the impact that we're trying to do as a fund not only by the technologies in which we invest but also the way that we do business and the way that we promote the industry.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:I really love hearing that. I'm speaking on a panel in a couple of hours about women in agriculture. So I've been doing some research and just looking at what it looks like in the startup world, this is in the US and it's across all startups, but we're going backwards. 2020 has been a bad year for women in business period. But this year, in 2020 2.3% of the startups funded were women founded down from 2.8%. So we're a little better than 99% men, but not far. And you have to do it on purpose. So I love that you're really paying attention to that. And that's really exciting, that's great. The other thing that struck me in what you said is, the part of pulling technologies out of universities. I think that's really interesting. It's kind of like the flagship model here in the US, flagship pioneering where they look for technologies and they build a team around it. And it's a very different model. Have you found that to be equally successful to the startup entrepreneur model or it's just a whole different model?
Ohad Zuckerman, COPIA Agro& Food Technologies Fund:I think it's much more efficient because if you're a startup and you want to establish a company, you invest huge amounts of money, millions of dollars including the team, getting laboratories, making trials, doing formulations, go to registration, all these things they cost a huge amount of money. If you go to our model, the research is done by the institutions that are very well equipped and they have amazing teams there. The development and commercialization is done by companies. That they've all the facilities, all the know how, all the market knowledge and they do the other part of the equation. So if you're able to connect these two and to create the fluent process, then you save huge amounts of money and you're much more efficient. Because the best people in every domain do what they have to know. The researchers do the research, the companies do the development and commercialization and we are doing the connection. Usually these two entities, business and academia do not speak the same language.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:Yeah.
Ohad Zuckerman, COPIA Agro& Food Technologies Fund:Just to give a simple example, take the issue of IT. Researchers usually are promoted because they publish articles. When they publish, you cannot write a patent. So there is always an issue when to publish, should we publish, what we will republish. And so this is something that always creates tension. If you know how to handle it and you create a win-win business. So we speak both languages, we know how to speak with researchers, we know how to speak with the industry. And we created a smooth process. And we know exactly how to differentiate between R&D to create a very, very coherent process. So basically, it's more efficient both financially and also from the operational point of view. So far we have 26 investments, eight different organizations here in Israel. And in addition to that, we also have two startups. So altogether 28 investments in the fund. So we have six project leaders, people that are industry professional freelancers that work on an hourly basis plus success fee, and they manage clusters of technologies like crop protection, food quality, aquaculture, genetics, et cetera. And they report to us and this way staff control is very well kept and managed. So that's a unique model. We don't really build startups around technologies, but we create cooperation with industry. And we act as a bridge between academia and industry and it works fantastically.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:Oh, I see. So you're not forming a company necessarily around the technology, but you're bringing the technology to companies that already are involved in that space.
Ohad Zuckerman, COPIA Agro& Food Technologies Fund:Yes and no. We do establish a special purpose company for every technology, which is the vehicle through which we make the investment in the research institution. Or we do the business development with the industrial partners. So there is a special purpose company for every technology and this is the way we manage it.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:I see, I see. So how do you see, you've been really involved in the agtech ecosystem and just in the time that I've known you, that it certainly has changed and grown. So how do you see the agtech ecosystem has grown in Israel in the last five years?
Ohad Zuckerman, COPIA Agro& Food Technologies Fund:Okay, so first of all we have a lot of startups, much more startups than we had in the last like five years ago. More food technology than agtech. Yes.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:Yeah, I always end up doing agtech ones, I guess. So I've seen so-
Ohad Zuckerman, COPIA Agro& Food Technologies Fund:Even though we do have enough agtech, there is a lot of food tech and the growth is mainly food tech. And I think that the majority, if not all of them, address the happy and not so hungry world. While the agtech companies do also address both the hungry world and the not hungry world. So from my point of view, first of all, there are many more companies. Second, more funds. And in Israel specifically there is a new vehicle for investment which is called R&D partnerships, which enables institutional investors to invest in public entities that invest in startups. So they do not invest directly in the startups, they invest in the R&D partnership and through this they get involved in the small companies. Because they will not move for 10, $20 million, they will move on for much more than that.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:Oh.
Ohad Zuckerman, COPIA Agro& Food Technologies Fund:So in addition... Yeah. And in addition to that the last thing is that you see more MNCs, more multinational companies coming to Israel directly. They've representations here, they do scouting here, they invest here and they are doing a lot of good work by helping the startups to focus more on what the industry really needs. So these are the main four things that I can tell you that happen. More companies, more investment vehicles and more MNCs and of course, the partnerships which is the new thing.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:So what technologies in the agtech side do you see that are the most interesting and promising right now?
Ohad Zuckerman, COPIA Agro& Food Technologies Fund:Well, I think that there are a lot of things that are going on. I cannot tell you on one thing which is specific because usually these are trends.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:Yeah.
Ohad Zuckerman, COPIA Agro& Food Technologies Fund:And it's difficult to talk about trends. Because you listen to the same interview two, three, four years down the road, maybe what you hear is old fashioned already. So I think that I would like to address something which is from our point of view with the fund that deals with a lot of projects and technologies is important. When we go to change from chemical to biologicals products. Okay, let's talk about for example, crop protection or enhancement of quality of fruits and vegetables, things like that. Then we come into the issue of formulations. And the formulations are something that the big companies usually used to do. And slowly, slowly, when the startup started to go into the business, then they found they need to do it. And today you have companies that specialize in formulations. This is something that is really missing in the industry. The expertise of creating new formulations for bio materials, I think this is very important. So that's one thing that I would like to point out. However if you talk about trends, I would say that in food it's all the protein substitutes, both plant based or the cultured meat.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:Mm-hmm (affirmative).
Ohad Zuckerman, COPIA Agro& Food Technologies Fund:And when you speak about agriculture is precision agriculture. So we talk about the protein substitute, I think that the plant based easier. Okay. And it's a matter of taste and honesty whether you think it's the same or not. That's one thing. The second thing is the cultured meat, it will take time. However, I think it's important. Nevertheless, until it's there and commercially available and affordable, people still need to look at the real meat producers and not neglect them. I think it is important. Even though we're impact funded, we look in the environment. Still, there is a world that we need to feed and it will take time until the real meat substitutes like cultured meat will be affordable and commercially available for everybody. So regarding agriculture, I think that precision agriculture is a buzzword. And here, again, I've got some things to say. I think that it's really nice to see the way that high tech comes into agtech.
Ohad Zuckerman, COPIA Agro& Food Technologies Fund:However, I met many, many companies and each one tells me that they will increase the yield by 15 to 20%. So let's take two or three like that or let's even take five, so the two plants will have to bear more and more and more fruits because if each one is right then it's going to multiply the fruit. So it's ridiculous, it's impossible that everyone will do that same, the same time. So first of all, it's very difficult to measure the incremental real contribution of every technology. That's one. Second, due to that it's very difficult to create a business model that is real and affordable to the grower and also good enough for the company. And the third thing is, think about the food grower that gets 20 notices to his cell phone from wanting irrigation, wanting fertilization, wanting crop protection, wanting like this and wanting like that, and he doesn't know what to do.
Ohad Zuckerman, COPIA Agro& Food Technologies Fund:So eventually I think that all three, maximum four players will be the ones that will purchase the best of breed from each one and unite them into one solution. And they integrate the knowledge and understanding and will come with a daily recommendation or a periodical recommendation to the grower. And this will take time. But I think this is where the industry will go. So as investors, we're very careful and we're looking at this. And we still didn't find the one that really can unite all the inputs from all their small startups that everyone has a wonderful solution. And we cannot still know how to measure precisely and to write business model for them. So I say, I think that people are rushing into it without giving enough thought to it. But certainly, it will happen, it's there. And I believe that eventually there will be three to four major supplier of these technologies altogether to the farm.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:Yeah, of course we're seeing the same thing in the US too. It's just you can see a grower with 15 different dashboards and none of them speak to each other. And it's really difficult to really act on those decisions when everything's coming in separately like that. So I think it's really important that we find some platforms that support all these different tools.
Ohad Zuckerman, COPIA Agro& Food Technologies Fund:Just to tell you one thing, I think that if you look at our portfolio there are a few things that I think may be interesting to tell you about. First of all, one of our companies is called ToBe, deals with the bees industry. As the bees are disappearing.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:Mm-hmm (affirmative).
Ohad Zuckerman, COPIA Agro& Food Technologies Fund:And there is a huge issue with the bees because they're the major pollinator of food crops. The main cause for the disappearance are viruses and certain mites that causes direct damage and also transmits the effect of the viruses into the hives. It's called the varroa mites. And this is the number one problem of the bees industries, the bee industry. And one of our company, ToBe, has a solution to that. And we see this as one of our major contribution in the future to the industry as a whole. That's one. The second one is post boost, which it's a material that enables to enhance the color, the taste and the shelf life of fresh fruits and vegetables. It's sprayed before harvest. It's an amazing material. And the last one which I think is important is grading specialty items. Personal melons, muskmelons, that are going to be a personal size and with edible rinds and with soft seeds so you can eat it as an apple.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:Oh, I love that.
Ohad Zuckerman, COPIA Agro& Food Technologies Fund:These are things, it's very interesting things for the PMA members. And there are two more technologies more on the production side which I think are interesting. What is called soil fire. It's a replacement of all the chemicals and not so environmental friendly crop protection materials that are used for soil disinfection before sowing and planting. This is an amazing material that doesn't harm the microbiome in the soil but it does kill weeds, noxious weeds, nematodes and fungus. For example, also the Panama disease found in live Fusarium. So this is an amazing a product. Another one is called bird up, it said to break the dormancy of birds of fruit trees. It's an amazing product, less toxic than Dormex, dramatically, not toxic actually. And safer and also does a better job. We have very good trials in the States and in Mexico and we believe this could be a very good product for American, South American growers. So this is just some examples of the things that we have in the fund that are very relevant to the agri food industry.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:Thank you for that. If people wanted to find out more about the companies, are those listed on your portfolio page on your website?
Ohad Zuckerman, COPIA Agro& Food Technologies Fund:Yes. I think that super fruiter, the one with the melons is not yet there. But the all the others are there. And one more thing, as investors now but in the past I managed companies and I was working with investors and working in agriculture. I think that it's very important that when people go to raise money, they will have the right team in place. Because investors invest in people, they do not invest in a technology or in a market because technologies can change and markets can change and trends are trends. And it's very important to have a team. So the entrepreneurs usually come on by themselves and we tell them listen, you need to come with a complete team that eventually or at least partial that will show us that you understand what is needed and that you have the right team next to you. Because we do invest in people. Always a good idea with an excellent team will do much better than an excellent idea with a poor team. So as an investor I can tell you that we do invest in people and I hope that there will be more women in the people we invest in.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:Next, you will hear from two companies in Israel that are using groundbreaking technologies to solve problems in the produce industry. Raviv Kula founder of FruitSpec provides yield estimates as a service based on hyperspectral machine vision technology. And then I will talk to a Elad Mardix, president of Clarifruit, a company addressing food shrink with an automated QC platform. So tell me about yourself in your company, please.
Raviv Kula, Fruit Spec:So my name is Raviv. I'm a veteran in the high tech industry for the last 22 years, mainly coming from communication, managerial role of product management, product marketing, marketing, sales, business development in the industry. About four and a half years ago, I sat down with a friend of mine for the last 25 years and we talked about hyperspectral technology that we believe that the potential is only scratching the surface of being used. And with this we debated among ourselves what we can do with this technology. And the Neil, my friend and now my co-founder, he's a citrus grower. And he said, look, in the place that we live there are many citrus growers but Shahar, which is the third co-founder and I are keep asking ourselves, how do we know how many foods we will have this year? And we thought of testing the hyperspectral technology to solve this question. And we tried two different technology and failed. But then the third one was weaker. We found the technology, we know how to see green foods at the early stage of the season.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:How long did that take, those trying the two things and then finding the one that worked. how long did that take?
Raviv Kula, Fruit Spec:Since we're dealing with fruits you have a season and you have to squeeze everything.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:That's agriculture.
Raviv Kula, Fruit Spec:If you want to capture everything you have two months, you don't have much more than that.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:Yeah.
Raviv Kula, Fruit Spec:It was about three months, four months. It was very difficult to get the equipment. But then once the third one was successful, I called my wife on my way back and I said, look, we have everything that we need, we're going to win the market. The technology was so profound that we can use it. And this is how we started FruitSpec.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:That's a great story. So what kind of insights do you give your clients? And you're solving the problem of yield, right? That's what the information that you're getting. And how do you work with clients and how do they get that information?
Raviv Kula, Fruit Spec:So we started with counting the number of fruits, but then we found out that nobody cares how many fruits they have. They speak about carton, they speak about weight, and not the number of fruits. Of course, the number of fruits is a fundamental component in this equation, but you need to know what the customer needs. And we found out first that the segment that we should target is the packing houses and not the grower because the value that we can bring them is much higher. And then after solving the issue of how many fruits, we found out that this problem of not knowing how many fruits it's actually lead to a much bigger problem of yield management. How do you manage the inventory of the fruits that you have in your orchard? What are the tools that you need in order to do that? And we found out that nobody is doing that.
Raviv Kula, Fruit Spec:I mean, there are some ERPs in the packing house, but they are doing some invoicing, transportation, shipments and so on. There are some farm management on the other side, they're doing the agronomy side of the business. But nobody is linking the orchard to the marketing. And we form, the marketing name is the food intelligence platform, that we provide yield management to our customers. Meaning, accurate data on how many fruits they have, what is the weight of the fruits, what is the weight going to be by the end of the season. So how many carton per size they will be able to pack from each orchard. And on the aggregated level what they will be able to sell. And we can provide this information in citrus, six to seven months before picking. In apple, stone fruits, three to four months before picking. And this is crucial for the profit and top line for the packing house.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:And it's a service, right? You don't have to sell anyone equipment, you go into the fields with your own equipment. That's how it works, right?
Raviv Kula, Fruit Spec:Yes, exactly. In any territory that we're serving, we have a local team that have our systems, have our vehicle and it's a service. So that the customer does not have to bother with buying the system, learning how to operate it and handling everything. We have coming, we scan, we go, the customers see the results through the web portal. It's very transparent, this operation to the customer.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:And what other crops do you work in addition to citrus?
Raviv Kula, Fruit Spec:So we're working on citrus, apples, stone fruits, grapes, we have plans to expand this year into, continue with the packing housing to berries and some other food types, but also for tropical fruits. So we have a very innovative solution for bananas yield management, pineapple, papayas. So we are expanding. The technology roughly is the same. I mean, as the same as the pattern that we got. But it is agnostic to any type of fruit. But the implication of how to do that and how to plan forward is something that we have for any fruit type separately. And as I said, we currently targeting for this year to go for bananas and pineapple, tropical fruits, but also expanding what we are doing to polygons, berries and so on.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:So it sounds like you're working outside of Israel then if you're going into tropical fruits. So what geographies are you in?
Raviv Kula, Fruit Spec:In Israel at the ethos of Israel is being agriculture, but the country is small and there are not a lot of export coming out of Israel for our fruits So we look at it as a kind of a lab that we can test a lot of things that we are doing. This week we done some cherries and berries over here in Israel. So we can test our equipment, our artificial intelligence models over here. And we have offices in the US, in California, the Central Valley, Chile, two offices in South Africa, one office in Spain, we have a minor operation in China. But this year we are going to expand and open at least two other offices during this year.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:Wow, that's a very wide spectrum. So this particular episode that I'm talking to people on is to kind of focus on Israel and that the ecosystem is like there and what it's like to do a startup there and the benefits. And so, you live there, that's where you're from. So it makes sense that you would start a company there. But what's the ag ecosystem, the agtech ecosystem like there? And has there been good access to funding? And has it been a good place to start a company?
Raviv Kula, Fruit Spec:It's an ecosystem, it's not just the system. There are some communities that assist, forming a company knowledge, connection. In Israel it's very wide and people do not hesitate to introduce you to either customer or to high level connections. So it's really, I can call everyday two, three, four, five CEOs for other startups and tell them look, I have a problem over here, how do you solve it? Okay. Either financial or something that is specific to the domain that we are doing, it's very common to do that. So the ecosystem is very open and helpful. The access to funding, it's changing. I mean, from the day that we started the backlog in the end of 2016, which was very difficult and only a few funds or investor were available to invest really in ag space, now it's a much more wider community, investors. And you can see, you can see the forming of big companies. Companies are going into the C and D rounds with 200 people, 500 people in a company. So the industry is maturing step by step.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:So the most companies that start in Israel, most companies must start with the idea of this is a good place to start but we have to be global for this company to make it. Is that kind of the thinking? Does anyone start and say, I'm an Israeli company and I'm going to serve the Israeli market. Or are most people thinking, I'm going to be broader and be a global company.
Raviv Kula, Fruit Spec:I think that 100% are looking to be global. I've got customers in the US that have around 10,000 hectares. I mean, in acres it's different. But-
Vonnie Estes, PMA:Yeah.
Raviv Kula, Fruit Spec:The overall citrus bearing land in Israel is about 15,000 hectares. So in comparison, you need the customers and you need to prove your technology is working outside of Israel. Investors are looking for the international reference and not just it's working over here in Israel.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:Mm-hmm (affirmative).
Raviv Kula, Fruit Spec:I must say that the acceptance from the customer, from the client point of view is quite the same. It's whether that you are a very small packing house or you are a huge packing house, they're always willing to hear what you're saying, understand and test it for sure. Israel is not different from the rest of the world in terms of attitudes towards agtech. The scale is much lower.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:Yeah, that makes sense. Well, there's such a great education system there and amount of talent. I've worked with a number of companies over the year more on the biology side and agriculture and it's just, the universities are fabulous. And so it's a wonderful breeding ground for sure for these types of companies to then go global.
Elad Mardix:I'm Elad Mardix. I'm the president of Clarifruit. And together with my two partners, Avi and Ruby, we actually established Clarifruit about three and a half years ago. And just maybe a word about how the idea came up. Clarifruit was born actually primarily through my partner, Avi, was really the product visionary of the company. And he used to work for HP for about 10 years before establishing Clarifruit. And at HP he actually ran on the R&D side, the world's largest automatic testing product for the software world. He's also coming from a farming family background. And in about 2017 he had a very interesting observation. And the observation he had was that software and fresh produce are actually very similar.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:Oh can't wait to hear how that is.
Elad Mardix:There you go. If you think about it, both software and fresh produce are merchandise whose quality is changing on a daily basis. It's very unique, as opposed to an iPhone or a chip that's coming out from a foundry and the minute it's being produced the quality is fixed. It's very different for both software as well as fresh produce. Now, 20 years ago HP has invented automatic testing for the software world because they recognize that the supply chain of software distribution was very inefficient and they needed to apply an automatic testing concept to this industry. Avi recognized that actually the fresh produce industry, which as we all know is a very long, complex and inefficient supply chain, will benefit enormously if there was an automatic testing concept applied to that supply chain. And that's really how the idea was born.
Elad Mardix:Clarifruit had essentially developed an automatic quality control platform for the fresh produce industry. Essentially what it means is, we developed software that has two components. Component number one is a mobile application that you can use on any smartphone that exists today in the market and actually allows you to perform a quality control inspection of your fresh produce in an automatic way through computer vision technology that we have developed and have patents on and some other integration that we have. And even more importantly, we have a web app, a management and analytic dashboard that generates in real time data and insights that really are not available today in any other parts.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:So you have customers all along the supply chain, can you tell us about your different customers and what problems you're solving for them?
Elad Mardix:Sure. So first let's start actually, who is our target customer? So if you think about it across the supply chain, from literally the grower down to the front store of the retailer, there are about 10 to 12 points today that people already perform a quality control inspection on a sample basis. Right between whatever, 0.5 to 2% of the supply that's coming in. It's already being tested today, just in a very manual way with very limited data. What we're doing is automating this inspection process, and effectively the entire supply chain who's performing those tests are going to be our customers. We started about two years ago going to the market and we focused on the marketing companies, the guys in the middle, the packer, shipper, that works with all of the growers on the upstream and sell to the retailers and wholesalers downstream. And we have expanded in the last actually six months downstream to the wholesaler and the retailer segments. So today we effectively work with the marketing companies downstream to the retailer. The pain point that we are addressing is multiple and it also depends on the segment that we are interacting. But if you think about it on a high level, the biggest pain point, and I'm talking dollars wise, right. The biggest pain point is the rejections that are taking place in the supply chain.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:Mm-hmm (affirmative).
Elad Mardix:Based on information that we've seen, the average supplier in the market is suffering from about 7% financial loss as a result of rejections. And at the end of the day, the automation that we have with the AI and computer vision technology and the digitization that we're allowing, there are all tools. They are tools in order to do two things. Number one, help the supply chain to reduce the rejections that they are experiencing today. And number two, give them real time data so they can make better decisions. Like who is the right guy to sell to? Where should they ship it based on shelf life prediction. And effectively help them maximize, I call it the wallet opportunity with the customers that they are interacting with.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:That's a great amount of information that can really help things move through the supply chain much better. So which crops are you working on and focusing on? Just anything that moves through the supply chain or are there particular crops that you focused on?
Elad Mardix:Okay. So maybe I explain just before I go there, explain for a minute the solution that we offer. Our platform essentially can digitize any fresh produce category that exists in the market today. Digitize means that, let's say you are a retailer who has 275 fresh produce categories, we can essentially upload all of those categories on our platform so you can digitize the entire quality control process and the quality standards that you're using., right. So your inspectors, wherever they are don't need to actually use pen and paper, Excel or an electronic form anymore, everything is going to be performed through the mobile app. Now, we have developed our own computer vision technology to be able to analyze external attributes like size and color and stem color automatically. Through algorithm we're just taking a picture from the smartphone and this solution today is already commercially available for 10 produce categories. Started with table grapes, then we went with tomatoes, stone fruit, cherries, bananas and pineapples, as well as the citrus family and apple. So altogether we have about 10 products category that are already automated, we're going to have 10 more added to that automation capabilities within 2021. And I expect that within the next two to three years, we'll get to the vast majority of the volume, which is about 45 products categories.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:Wow. So you truly are a global company working across the supply chain of wherever the food's going. Where in the world are your customers? What different regions are you working in?
Elad Mardix:So about two years ago when we really started to go global, our first international customers who was in Spanish, which is in Chile and Israeli, is the world's largest exporter of stone foods, one of the top five in grapes. So we started really in Latin America and we have a very strong presence there today across Chile, Peru and Mexico. We then expanded to North America, both in Canada as well as in US. But I would say that probably the strongest market for us has been Europe, where we work with multiple very big marketing companies as well as the retailer.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:And do you have offices there, people on the ground in these different areas? Or are you able to do it all from Israel?
Elad Mardix:So good question because the answer would have been very different in March, last year before the COVID. So today we actually have offices both in the Americas, North America and in Latin America as well as in Europe. They usually, those offices include sales team as well as operation team that essentially helps with the initial implementation. But what's interesting is that in the last year, especially between March to December in 2020 because of COVID, we worked with customers globally. And I'll mention just one of them for example, we just started to work with Doyle International. We're all of the QC for Doyle's pineapples, bananas and we'll do the other categories as well. And the entire implementation process for Doyle, which took about four months, has been performed totally remotely. So we do have the local operations to honestly help close the loop, quicken. But we have demonstrated the ability to actually implement very complex project with very large customers in a total remotely way.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:So this episode of the podcast is focusing on Israel. And there are an amazing number of agtech and food tech companies that have started in Israel and most of them are global. Why do you think that is? Why do you think it's such a good place to start companies and why are there so many good companies that have launched there?
Elad Mardix:So I think the answer here is twofold. From a technology perspective, Israel is probably in the top two ecosystems in terms of technology entrepreneurial. Number one is probably the Silicon Valley and Israel is right behind it. So Israel is a leader within technology, entrepreneurship and development in any technology sector, right, not necessarily agri tech. This is a result of the nature of the people and I think a lot of the cultural related attributes that people are growing into. Specifically for the agtech and fresh produce in our case, to be honest, the local supply chain here, let's say within fresh produce, has a much higher or stronger propensity for technology adoption than you would usually find for other fresh produce players in the supply chain. So I just think it's easier to get your first couple of customers here like the beta product and check it with them. And we find the product initially before you go out to the world. And people here also on the supply chain side would be receptive for errors and mistake and they understand how it works. And that's I think the important underlying mechanism that enable new technologies to flourish out of Israel.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:Oh, that's really interesting. I haven't heard that point of view before. But that makes a lot of sense. So what new technologies do you think are still needed in the produce industry at this point? And do you see those being developed?
Elad Mardix:Yeah, so there's a lot of new technology that I can think of for the entire supply chain, obviously. But I'm going to focus on technologies which are related to the quality, which I think again, quality is important in any business, right. But as I mentioned before, in the fresh produce supply chain, it's more important than anywhere else because the quality actually changes on a daily basis. So it's really tricky to be able to measure it. I think two things are very important that should happen over the next three to four years. Number one, I would like to see the digitization trend really taking off across the entire supply chain, not just in specific silos and the retailer. For example, it really needs to go across the entire supply chain. And we have seen by the way a huge acceleration of that since June last year.
Elad Mardix:And the reason I think it's important to happen is because if we really want to be able to figure out the shelf life prediction accurately in order to help in reducing the waste in this industry, the only way to figure out shelf life is by having digitization and collaboration of data across the entire supply chain. One silo having the information is not going to do the work. So that's one thing that is really important. And I do see a bunch of other startups and companies attacking this digitization trend from different places. And I'm really hopeful that we're all going to be successful in convincing the suppliers and the retailers that this is going to create a lot of value for these guys. The second new technology that I'm hopeful will be relevant to the supply chain is hyperspectral technology. Okay, so if you remember I mentioned that we developed our own computer vision technology to take pictures and analyze automatically external attributes.
Elad Mardix:The technology that it's being performed on is the camera that we all have in our iPhone and Android devices. And it can only measure external attributes today, including defects. But only external. The holy grail would be that you Vonnie will take a picture and it will be able to analyze not just the external attributes but also the bricks or firmness, acidity, pH because then you're actually going to be able to analyze the quality of the fruit or vegetables and get a grade instantly. And when that happens, our technology is going to be applicable not just to the professional supply chain from the farmer to the retailer, but also to the consumer. And I think when we get this hyperspectral technology, which by the way, already exists. It just cost between 15 to $20,000 per camera in the sorting machines.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:Might need to get that cost down a little.
Elad Mardix:Well, yeah. And people are working on that. But I think it's probably going to be in the next five years when we start getting this technology into the camera of our smartphones. And at that point of time, the way it's going to play out is you're going to be able to pull up the Clarifruit app from your phone, go to the supermarket and before you buy these blueberry or watermelon, you just take a picture and you'll get instantly the quality grade and the shelf life prediction. And that's going to be a whole game changer for the industry in terms of waste reduction. But again, we're going to need hyperspectral technology to get to the smartphones, and that's probably four, five years away from us. So today, we're focusing on the professional supply chain, automating, decreasing process with the combination of their industry devices like the factor meter and dura meter. But really the vision is to be able to do it for everyone down to the consumer as soon as we can get this technology to the smartphone.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:Wow, such wonderful conversations. As I mentioned at the start, I had so many exciting companies to talk to in Israel, I'm doing another episode.

With little farming land, Singapore imports 90% of the food it consumes. Coupled with the recent supply chain shocks, the government has set up a number of programs and incentives for local food production and innovation. In this episode, we hear from there different companies in the well-functioning AgTech ecosystem in Singapore. Benny Chng from SGInnovate discusses the companies they are investing in at this time and why food and ag are important. We also hear from Foong Yoke Oon who with her husband is building Ubertas Agritech, a vertical farm to serve Singapore. And Adrian Teo from DiMuto a global commerce solution company for the produce market. These three conversations illustrate what a good ecosystem can bring to a sector with government support, private sector financing and smart entrepreneurs.

Vonnie Estes, PMA:Welcome to PMA Takes on Tech. The podcast that explores the problems, solutions, people, and ideas that are shaping the future of the produce industry. I'm your host, Vonnie Estes, Vice President of Technology, for the Produce Marketing Association. And I've spent years in the agtech sector, so I can attest, it's hard to navigate this ever-changing world, in developing, and adopting new solutions to industry problems. Thanks for joining us, and for allowing us to serve as your guide to the new world of produce and technology. My goal of the podcast is to outline a problem in the produce industry, and then discuss several possible solutions that can be deployed today.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:Stout Industrial Technology collaborates with customers to build and launch industrial technology solutions that are designed to last. The smart cultivator combines a proprietary, agriculturally proven, mechanical platform, with Stout True Vision technology to eliminate weeds, and cultivate ground in a single pass. Visit stoutagtech.com, that's S-T-O-U-T-A-G-T-E-C-H.com to learn more.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:With little farming land, Singapore imports over 90% of the food consumed in the country. The food at local markets mainly comes from overseas. In 2019, the government announced its 30 by 30 policy agenda, aiming to produce at least 30% of its nutritional needs domestically by 2030, while also strengthening and securing its external food sources. In April 2020, the Singapore Food Agency established the 22.6 million dollar, 30 by 30 express grant scheme, to help local agrifood producers rapidly increase production in three key categories: eggs, fish, and leafy vegetables. In September 2020, nine urban farms were offered 29 million dollar grants, by the Singapore Food Agency, as part of efforts to support the growth of local agrifood enterprises and ramp up local food production over the next 24 months. And then, in February 2021, the Singapore government announced that it will dedicate 45.2 million dollars for a new agritech fund, that will focus on supporting farmers through the use of technology, that ultimately boosts domestic food production. The purpose of the Agri-food Cluster Transformation Fund is to help farmers through the use of technology in local food production.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:So there's much focus by the government to develop technology and produce food, in and for Singapore. Singapore is also a financial hub, with a number of investors willing to put money into early stage technologies, along with a talented and trained work force. Today we will hear from three very different voices on what is happening in Singapore, in agtech. First, Benny Chng from SGInnovate, will talk about the companies they are investing in at this time, and why food in Ag are important. Next, we will hear from Foong Yoke Oon, who with her husband is building a vertical farm. And finally, from Adrian Teo, from DiMuto, a global commerce solution company for the produce market. Let's drop into the conversation with Benny.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:We have with us, Benny Chng, from SG Innovate in Singapore. Welcome to the show, Benny.
Benny Chng, SGInnovate:Hi, thank you for having me. Hi Vonnie.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:Hi. So tell us a little about yourself and also your role at SGInnovate.
Benny Chng, SGInnovate:Okay. You've got my name already, I'm Benny Chung, an assistant director here at SGInnovate. And I focus on the agrifood investments that we do as a company. So SGInnovate is a Singapore government-backed, early stage, Deep Tech venture capital firm. We focus on a number of areas of interest, and these include agrifood, smart manufacturing, healthcare and biomedical sciences, and sustainability. So in a nut shell, that's what we do, but we also focus on investments from the deep stage all the way up to Series B, for a first investment. And we also have a global investment mandate, so we're not just limited to investments in Singapore itself. We've done investments, for example, in United States, in Israel, and interestingly, all the way in Estonia. So there's a good mix right there.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:Yeah. Great. So what do you personally focus on? Do you focus on all those areas? Or do you focus more on the food side, or what's your specialty?
Benny Chng, SGInnovate:Yeah, so I focus very much on agrifood in the way that we approach agrifood investment. We are a bit of an early stage, seeker fund of sorts. So I'm sure our listeners here today would be very familiar with the likes of Temasek or GIC, or at least heard of these companies.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:Uh huh.
Benny Chng, SGInnovate:So they are our primary investors in a number of different areas. So we try and identify the up and coming investment trends, in the areas that we invest in. So in agrifood, we look at things that we have not invested just yet. But could be interesting for them, in the next two to five years. And we focus on investments where there is a technology defensibility. So for us, that's where we would try and catch an early wave and take the early risk, and identify possible winners in the next couple of years.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:That's fascinating. That kind of brings me to my next question of just talking about the ecosystem. So you kind of serve a little bit as a feeder of identifying those trends earlier than some of maybe the larger investment companies would.
Benny Chng, SGInnovate:Yup.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:So tell us about the agtech ecosystem, and it really seems to be growing and thriving in Singapore. So what does it look like and what sorts of companies are involved?
Benny Chng, SGInnovate:Okay. Well that's a question with probably a very, very long answer, so hang in there. So as a country, we're not a very big country, as our listeners I think would know. Singapore is a tiny place, it doesn't even compare to some of the cities in the United States, in terms of geographic size. But interestingly, although we only have say about 1-2% of our land used for agriculture, we produce 10% of our food just from that.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:Oh.
Benny Chng, SGInnovate:Which isn't too bad, but it's just 10%. So the Singapore government, we have seen all of the disruptions caused by COVID-19, with the issues around the Suez Canal. And food security, food resilience, is a big topic for us. So the Singapore government, through the Singapore Food Agency, which is the regulator here in Singapore, very similar to the FDA, or somewhat similar to the FDA in the States, set a target of producing 30% of our nutritional needs by 2030. So very catchy, 30 by 30, we are doing this in a number of different ways. On the agricultural side, there is a push towards automation, towards providing more land for our agricultural needs. So we're developing, for example, a agricultural pop. Very similar in many ways, to a business pop, 18 hectares, which isn't big by United States standards, but in Singapore it's a big deal. In the northern part of the country, where we will be setting aside land for farms, and for poultry, for livestock, for the growth of different crops. So we're looking into that space. We're encouraging the people also, to look into having their own family plots if you will.
Benny Chng, SGInnovate:A lot of the people here in Singapore, live in high-rise flats and condominiums and so forth. But we're using some of the spaces available, even in these flats, to have little plots of homemade gardens, if you will. So we're encouraging that in small ways, so that people have a feel for that. So that's at that level. At the corporate side, there are a number of different companies involved in agriculture in Singapore. It starts all the way from the producer side. So I've briefly mentioned about the farms that produce our agricultural crops and work with livestock, so we've got a number of these sorts of companies. A number of them are modernizing. So just the other day in the news, there was this sheep farm that is moving into a six story facility, I think in the next year or the year after.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:Wow.
Benny Chng, SGInnovate:We will be able to take care of all of the sheep in a clean way, keep them comfortable, make sure that the temperature is all right for them, no stress. So there are things that we are doing around these areas, together the corporates here in Singapore. So you've got the producers, along further down the line, you've got folks that help the food processing, you've got folks that help the supply chains. And this is a company they've already heard of. It's a popular company of ours, DiMuto, that does the supply chain and logistics for fruits, as a start. They're looking at other products as well, but fruits is a first start. And they have signed a number of different deals, with different companies all around the world, but it's all built from Singapore.
Benny Chng, SGInnovate:So we've got producers, we've got the people down in the middle in food processing and supply chain logistics. We've also got a big emphasis on food and food tech. So we've got lots of ground based here in Singapore, for delivery. You've got so many different restaurants from so many different places. And you've got, of course, all of the new up and coming food tech companies developing new ingredients, new foods. So it's a really growing and vibrant ecosystem of food and agri players that we have in the country, but we are looking of course to grow it out. One thing I forgot to mention is Bühler and Givaudan, it's the large food processing companies. They have a joint lab that they're setting up, opening end of this month actually, looking at plant base food processing. So exciting things are happening in Singapore, happy to dive more into each of these, if there's time for that.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:Okay.
Benny Chng, SGInnovate:But again, sorry, long answer to what should have been a... It's a short version of long answer.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:Yeah, well there's a lot going on, so you have to answer it long. So you mentioned the 30 by 30 from the government, so is the government actually putting money in? Is the government one of the investors in trying to build the ecosystem?
Benny Chng, SGInnovate:Yup. So the Singapore government does provide a fair amount of support, some of it's financial, some of it is too, different initiatives and schemes and programs. Schemes tends to have a bit of a negative connotation overseas. But here in Singapore, scheme is a fairly neutral word, it's just a program. But we do have a number of these initiatives that government has put forward. Singapore government acts as a capitalist in a number of different ways. We don't intend to crowd out private sector investment, it's just to kick start what was already happening. So there has been a lot of interest from agrifood players that come into Singapore, to do something here in Singapore, but we just want to kick start it and move it a lot faster. And then let private sector take over.
Benny Chng, SGInnovate:But directly to your question and to your point, we for example, have 144 million dollars set aside in the next couple of years to find a number of these initiatives. And hopefully, when more and more private sector players are coming in, setting up facilities, putting in their resources, and government can then taper back some of these initiatives, some of this funding. And let private sector run with that. So yeah, again in a nutshell, Singapore government is going to help, but not to crowd out the private sector and take over the private sector's good work.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:So in funding new technologies and new companies, where does the money come from them... And there is companies like you, but are there other investors that are involved? Do corporates help fund technology? And are there other investors outside of Singapore that invest in technology in Singapore?
Benny Chng, SGInnovate:Oh yeah, for sure. So regionally, Singapore is a financial hub in Asia, so that extends also to venture capital and private equity investment. So I've very briefly covered some of the public sector investment entities here in Singapore, so that's SG Innovate, Temasek, GIC. There's also EDBI, which represents the Economic Development Board. Also there are a number of these players, but there's also very large private sector interest that we have as well.
Benny Chng, SGInnovate:A number of these firms are based here in Singapore, and they are starting to invest more heavily in agfood. So we've got a full gamete here of accelerators, incubators, going up to your VCs, your private equity firms. A number of the corporates also have invested alongside some of these financial investors. So corporate VCs, or the corporate arms themselves come in and invest directly off the ballot sheet, so we've got that. And because of our status as a financial hub, a number of foreign entities have also decided that this is a good place to invest. And setting aside the fact that we are a financial hub, we also have science and technology in the region.
Benny Chng, SGInnovate:So we've got a number of great facilities here, state-of-the-art facilities, people who have been well trained, who speak a number of different languages. I speak two, one not very well, but I speak... So a number of Singaporeans are able to do at least two. So this is a center of commerce, of science and technology, so it does bring together a number of different anchors who are interested to invest, to support companies growing out of Singapore.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:This may be hard to answer, because I'm sure it's different for every single person. But a lot of the people in the U.S., that go into agtech and really are trying to develop technology for food, grew up on a farm and that's their background and that's what they know. We also have a number of people who are people who grew up here where I live, in Silicon Valley, and they're the tech side and they try to take that to agriculture. Since there are not that many people in Singapore that grew up on a farm, how do people get interested in agriculture and food? Where does that interest come from?
Benny Chng, SGInnovate:Okay. Number of ways to answer this question. First of all, Singapore is a food nation. We come from many different lands, our folks, our ancestors, they came from places like China, India, the Malay Archipelago around us. So the one way that has helped connect all of the people, here in Singapore, is through food.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:How interesting.
Benny Chng, SGInnovate:So it has always been an area of interest. And there are some unique Singaporean dishes that you wouldn't find anywhere else, thanks to the mix that we have. So in the first place, the nation, as a whole, the people here are naturally inclined and predisposed to be interested in food. That's the first thing. The second thing is, in spite of our small land size, actually historically, a number of people grew up on small family plots. Tiny, really tiny by global standards, but we lived in... At least my parent's generation or my grandparents and the ones before them, they lived in tiny family plots, where they could grow their own fruit and all of that. So my mom has a lot of stories about growing all sorts of different fruits, Durian, which is not very popular. But there's Durian, there's papayas, and all of that.
Benny Chng, SGInnovate:So all the generation, they still have memories of their own family plots, of growing all of these things, of being self-reliant, of putting food on the table through their own hard work, doing it and growing it by themselves. And fishing, and all of that. So we've had that historically, it's just as the country has modernized in the last 50 years, some of that has gone away. But our natural interest towards food, all the generations interest in growing their own food hasn't quite gone away just yet. So there are people who are still interested to for one, get into food because they're interested in it. Two, to rediscover their roots and to find out what exactly it was that their parents, or their grandparents found interesting. I can't say that everybody would naturally be interested in food, just because of these two factors. But naturally interested in going to food as a career or agriculture as a career because of these two factors, these two factors I think have helped a number of people rediscover agriculture in Singapore and want to take part in growing the space. So again, a long answer to a short question.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:No that's fascinating. It's really interesting. You just wonder how people end up getting excited by food, and those are great reasons. So are there any technologies that you see are needed, or any solutions that technologies could solve, that you see are needed that aren't being developed? Or that you're hoping new technologies will start being developed? Does that make sense?
Benny Chng, SGInnovate:Yeah. It does. We are excited about a number of different things. On the agricultural side, I think we are excited to find ways to reduce the incidents and prevalence of disease in crops, in livestock and in fishstock. So that's one of the directions in which we are exploring. It's possible to develop better vaccines, or probiotics, or products of that nature, in which we can help increase these yields and reduce disease. That's one aspect that we are exploring.
Benny Chng, SGInnovate:The other, I think in agriculture is to maximize, or to increase yield. I think the Green Revolution in the 60s did already show that, but a lot of it is geared towards countries where, by in large, there is plenty of space. And a country like Singapore, where there's not a lot of space, we're still trying to see how we can bring up the yield. And that's something else that we're considering as well, so that we can surpass our 30 by 30 goal.
Benny Chng, SGInnovate:On the food side, we are looking at different things that we could potentially do. We've gotten to a point here in Singapore, where we've modernized, we've become a first world country of sorts. We've gotten all the developed world issues, if you will, around obesity and diabetes and all of these chronic conditions. So we are looking at what we could do to replace, for example, or reduce fat and sugar and salt. And yet, not compromise our taste. One thing that consumers can't quite get around, even they do want healthier food. As we know, eating less tasty food, they can't deal with that.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:Mm-hmm (affirmative).
Benny Chng, SGInnovate:So if you want healthier food, you will still need to at least maintain the taste, if not make it tastier. So we are looking at new ingredients that could potentially play that role, on the food side. So broadly speaking, in terms of things that interest us very much, we're looking for new technologies in these areas.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:So a lot of the companies in Singapore, when they develop products, or they look at building a company, are they looking at mostly the Singapore market? Or are they mostly looking at, ""We're going to make a product here and then sell it to the global market?"" Or some mix of both?
Benny Chng, SGInnovate:Well it's probably more of the ladder. The market here in Singapore is tiny. We've got just over 5 million, close to 6 million people in Singapore. If we want to compete on a global stage, be conscious of this market... So all of the startups that we invest in, we need them to have a global mindset. We would love for their businesses to be anchored here in Singapore, so they can do all of the RMD here, product development here, but if the target market sales is only Singapore, that's not interesting. It's not going to be a global winner. And for us, we need to be clear about our way. Because otherwise we would be, to be very frank, an insignificant speck on a global map. So I appreciate your words. And having all of our companies here in Singapore adopt that global mindset, where it's great to be anchored here in Singapore, but you also need to think about how you can reach the global market, how you can sell to different people overseas. And that's really the goal for companies here in Singapore.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:I used to work in industrial biotech for some period of time, and worked for a company that we had a lab in Singapore. We worked through the economic development group and just the incentives to have a lab in Singapore were really good, the financial incentives, and then the talent was amazing. The people that we could get to work for us, that were really good biologists, were surpassed to many different places. So you've got a lot of advantages there, of having some support, and then having really great talent. So that's a great place to build companies, for sure.
Benny Chng, SGInnovate:Oh, thank you for your kind words. We can't rest on our laurels, so it's a lot of pushing up and then above and beyond where we can.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:Yeah. So can you talk a little bit about the companies that you're currently either just invested in, or you probably can't talk about the ones you haven't invested in, but just kind of what are some of the investments that you've done recently, is my last question.
Benny Chng, SGInnovate:Okay. So here in Singapore, the investor in DiMuto, like I mentioned earlier, there are a couple of other companies that we invested in. I think for us, as a company, we're focused slightly more on the food side. So we for example, invested in a company called Ai Palette, that does a bit of social media listening and identifies food trends that are coming. So to just give an example, there was a little bit of food trend a couple of years ago, where there was this salted egg yolk mix. It may sound a bit weird to foreign listeners, but salted egg yolk mix, which has this very nice savory feel to it. And people started adding it to all sorts of food products, so you have salty egg yolk burger, and all of that. So the problem for FMCGs, is identifying when such trends occur. And the Ai Palette is able to do that through social listening.
Benny Chng, SGInnovate:And this trend, if I may take a step back, it came up because a café started serving certain products that included this product, this salted egg yolk mix. And people started sharing on social media, ""This is great, this is wonderful, it tastes fantastic, smells great."" You know, all of that. And people started picking it up and it had been café to café to café over there, their side copying that. But FMCG was slow on the uptick for the product. So I think about a year and a half after people got excited about it in the cafe, we only start seeing it appearing on shelves, FMCG said, ""Okay, this is interesting, let's try something."" McDonald's came onto the bandwagon. So Ai Palette then serves as a way for FMCGs for big brands to try short circuited process. They discover that people are interested in a particular food trend, and they start working on products that potentially can be served, to ride that wave. So that's a company that focuses on that.
Benny Chng, SGInnovate:As an investor, we've been around for 25 years now. So we have invested in a couple of companies in agfood. Even before this term wasn't as big here in Singapore, is overdone, for example restaurant AI, ordering, even before it was a thing. So we've done a number of these things in the past, but we're trying to ramp up. And like I said, we don't just invest in Singapore, so a number of our investments are overseas as well. We invested in an Israeli company, for example, that does sugar replacement. It uses a sweet protein to replace sugar. Tastes exactly like it, I tried it, wonderful. And it doesn't have any insulin response, so it's potentially going to be a life changer for diabetics, where the taste of your drinks, your food, doesn't change. But you don't have any issues, in relation to diabetes. So we're, fingers crossed, very excited about that product.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:What's it made from? Is it a plant? Or is it through fermentation, what's it made from?
Benny Chng, SGInnovate:Yeah. So it's fermentation. But it's based off a sweet protein that's only found in Africa. It's a fruit that's quite rare. Very easily bruised, can't be easily transported overseas. They looked at the characteristics of their protein that's produced from this fruit. Reject a bit of the protein, but interestingly, it's a NON GMO. And they ferment it then, and that protein is added then to your drinks and to your food products. You just need a minute amount of it because it's super sweet. It's 3,000 times sweeter than sugar.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:Wow. Fascinating.
Benny Chng, SGInnovate:Yeah, it's a product we're excited about.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:I'll have to look that up. Because yeah, people have been trying to solve that one for a long time, so that's really exciting.
Benny Chng, SGInnovate:Oh yeah, yeah, for sure. So we're looking now, other than alternative sugar, we're trying to look at alternative fat, alternative salt, alternative anything that can help us be healthier, have the food taste the same, and is cheap. So we're looking at things like that.Vonnie Estes, PMA:Great insights from Benny. We will now hear from Foong Yoke Oon, talk about building her vertical farm business, followed by DiMuto's global commerce company.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:So please tell me a little about yourself and your business.
Foong Yoke Oon, Ubertas AgriTech Pte Lt:Okay, well actually the chief driver of my farm is actually my husband, who I call the chief farmer. He comes from an IT technology telcore background. He's been doing that for 30 years and he took an early retirement, and he suddenly sort of doing farming. So he did prototyping for a couple of years in a small greenhouse space, up in the north of Singapore. I think without a clear background in farming, you need to do a lot of trial and error, a lot of research. And that's what he started doing. I've come from a marketing business development background. I was raised as part of another company in Singapore, part of Economic Development Board.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:Oh.
Foong Yoke Oon, Ubertas AgriTech Pte Lt:They promote a lot of investments in Singapore. I was there initially for a couple of years and then I did hunting for a couple of years.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:Oh.
Foong Yoke Oon, Ubertas AgriTech Pte Lt:And I've actually been a stay-at-home mom for the last maybe 20 years now. And getting back to work right now.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:So when did the business start? When did you first start it?
Foong Yoke Oon, Ubertas AgriTech Pte Lt:We actually started doing a bit of market research about 2019, we started to speak to some restaurants and people who were maybe interested to be our customers. And it was a real chicken and egg situation, we approach restaurant and they tell us, ""Oh, okay that's good. Do you have any samples? Can we come and see?"" And we say, ""Oh, we haven't started yet."" But it was also very difficult for us to say, ""Look, let's clunk in a couple hundred thousand to do this."" Without actually knowing that the business is out there. We went through this situation where we couldn't move on. And we said, ""Okay. We'll do this.""
Foong Yoke Oon, Ubertas AgriTech Pte Lt:And my brother, who owns actually his own law firm, started to put in some money, as well. So we decided to just start up, and this is in late 2019. And we were in the midst of fitting out, when 2020 came and all, in March and April. And we were in complete lockdown. So everything had to stop, our contractors were stuck in Malaysia, they couldn't come out to Singapore. Equipment couldn't come in. So basically, for the whole of 2020, our premises was just left empty. We couldn't get me started into late 2020. So we basically really started planting late 2020, early 2021. So it really effectively, only January this year.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:So are you supplying customers now? Or are you still in the testing phases?
Foong Yoke Oon, Ubertas AgriTech Pte Lt:We've gone through I think two, three cycles now. And we've started initially with planting our kale and that's done quite well. We are still talking to restaurants, but I think in the time that my husband started prototyping five, six years ago till now, a lot of vertical open farms have started in Singapore. One or two have gotten very big, but there are also quite a number of small companies, like us, to startup in a small premises. Ours is about 3,000 square feet. So there is a lot of players out there and it's getting very competitive. And as we approach restaurants, they come and tell us that we've got a lot of suppliers. Pricing is a big issue for them, so it's been a bit difficult to bring into the restaurant market. So in the meantime, we've decided to do more of an online business.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:Oh.
Foong Yoke Oon, Ubertas AgriTech Pte Lt:We're building a website right now, and I think what we would like to do, is to do subscription boxes. So there will be a weekly box of five, six farmer's picks of varieties. We hope to get you on board, if we do numerous orders, we do free delivery, there will be free pick up. And I think eventually, we might also like to do a membership scheme, where if you pay a certain monthly or yearly fee, the price of the box will go down, different sort of concessions to it. So I think for a start, we'll do that because I think it will be easier to get those numbers in, for the beginning stages, while we work on our selected restaurants to market to.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:How will you do the delivery? Will you do it yourselves? Or is there a service that will do the delivery for you-
Foong Yoke Oon, Ubertas AgriTech Pte Lt:Yeah, we've got a vendor, will come in and do delivery. Because we don't expect to be doing a daily delivery, if you order the vegetables by Friday, Saturday, we'll deliver by Monday. And maybe another one for midweek, we'll also offer a pickup service. Singapore is very small, so it's not difficult to do deliveries, you can drive more than half an hour from one end to the other.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:Are you mostly doing leafy greens? Or what all are you growing?
Foong Yoke Oon, Ubertas AgriTech Pte Lt:At the moment we are doing, we've got a lot of kale, we've got about three varieties of kale, we're doing curly kale, kale toscano, we also have a lot of basil, mizuna, summer rocket, we've done some kalian, and we've also done strawberries.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:Strawberries, wow.
Foong Yoke Oon, Ubertas AgriTech Pte Lt:Yes, very difficult because they need lots of TLC. We germinated in December and I think we saw the first fruit in March. It's not very consistent. And actually, one of the restaurants we provided samples to, they really liked our strawberries, because they look like wild strawberries. They're not very even and the texture's a little bit unique. And she wanted 100 pieces a week and we said we can deliver. I think it's a showcase for a lot of farmers, that they can grow strawberries in Singapore, indoor. But I think to do a consistent delivery and volume and of quality as well, will be very difficult.
Foong Yoke Oon, Ubertas AgriTech Pte Lt:So I think most greens, we can do herbs, we're doing also radishes. About several varieties of lettuces. We're growing back Chye and Ice Plant. So I think most leafy greens are growing quite well. We just need to get the consistency of the cycles, to make sure that every week we have five, six varieties growing and maybe to actually change varieties on a weekly basis. So that if you order a box from us, the next box will have two, three things that are different.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:Mm-hmm (affirmative). That sounds great. So do you plan to expand? Do you think you'll build another facility? Or is just doing this one going to be plenty?
Foong Yoke Oon, Ubertas AgriTech Pte Lt:I guess we are kind of really at the first stage right now, because ours is a vertical racking system. So right now we are only doing two levels. Not even fully two levels yet, maybe half of two levels. We can go up to four levels, but it would require lots of equipment, in terms of actually going up particularly quite high. So I think we would like to see how the subscription boxes go. I've started some initial marketing on Facebook and on IG as well. So I'm trying to develop a sort of interest with that. So I mean, for a start, we've gotten quite a good following right now. We want to launch the website actually sometime this week, so that you can order for next week. We plan to harvest in a week or two, so let's see how the numbers grow. I don't think we can even do 50, 60 boxes for a start because we haven't built up the volume. And it would be sort of a step-by-step approach.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:Did you get any funding from the government? Does the government support businesses like yours? Or is it mostly friends and family that invested?
Foong Yoke Oon, Ubertas AgriTech Pte Lt:Well, the Singapore government is actually on the real campaign and mission now. And they have a 30 by 30 target, to grow 30% of what we consume. I think COVID highlighted the problem that we are very reliant on food exports. And if there were to be another complete shutdown, I think it would be very difficult. We can't stockpile a lot of food, especially perishables, we can't do that. We truck in a lot of vegetables from Malaysia, we are very reliant on that. So when COVID happened, it was difficult. They had to find sources from elsewhere. So the government, in the past two years, has launched a 30 million dollar grant to help farmers build up the projection in Singapore. As you know, we are very late start.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:Yeah.
Foong Yoke Oon, Ubertas AgriTech Pte Lt:So what they're trying to do is just get the traditional farms to actually re-engineer themselves to do a lot of high technology farming. So it means compact spaces, by building up, by using a lot more technology, so we don't use the label, which is expensive in Singapore. So there's a very, very big drive. We've approached Singapore Food Agency, with a lead agency in Singapore, to promote, in terms of getting grants. We are still in discussion with them, but they would like us to also prove that we are very technologically advanced. So you need to be able to put in parameters where your use of lighting, or use of water has improved in terms of using technology, so productivity improvements have to be there.
Foong Yoke Oon, Ubertas AgriTech Pte Lt:So we are talking to them, so the government is very supportive. But I think small businesses, it's also difficult because we are starting up more, we have to think about the business and yet we have to put up this huge proposal to prove to the government that we are very productive, we've applied a lot of technology to actually get the grants. But in the last budget... In fact, the 30 million has already been used up because there are a lot of small open farms now. I would suspect about 10, 15 now. So it's a new trench of about 30, 40 million that they've put in the budget for this sector. And it's not just for vegetable farming, but for fish farming and prawn farming as well. So there's a lot of agriculture, I think the fish farming is also advanced a lot in Singapore, in terms of doing it in indoor spaces.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:Please tell me about yourself and your company.
Adrian Teo, DiMuto:So my name is Adrian and I work for DiMuto, I'm the Chief Operating Officer for DiMuto. DiMuto is a Singapore based blockchain traceability company. We started in March 2019, so we are a little over two years old. And we have developed a solution that allows us to use blockchain, to track and trace produce from farm to table. And primarily, trying to solve issues like trade disputes, arising from the lack of data visibility in our suppliers traits. But also on the retail side, helping retailers understand where their produce comes from. And then also allowing them and empowering them with the tools to then be able to engage with their end consumers. Yeah.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:Great. So there's so many services packed into that answer. So who are your main paying customers? What part of the chain do people actually pay you and extract the value? And then can you tell us about some of the customers and then what are some of the services that people use the most.
Adrian Teo, DiMuto:Yeah, great question Vonnie. So actually that short introduction I had, wasn't all the services we provide actually. But the main key customers that we target are the ones who are actually supplying it. So the farm producers, or even a packing house, exporters even. Because they are the ones that in the first place, would get the most pinpoints. So I'll give you an example all right, so we have several customers out of Europe, Southeast Asia. But they do trades with China. So a lot of times what they face, is buyers from China would tell them that, ""Hey, as a result of a quality issue, when we receive your goods, we're just going to write off 20% or 10% of credit just as claims.""
Vonnie Estes, PMA:Oh.
Adrian Teo, DiMuto:But yeah exactly, and the suppliers would then be puzzled, right. Because they are thinking, ""Wait a second, I sent this in great conditions. It's been a painstaking harvest season for us. We've put so much tender loving care into ensuring that our products are great. Sent that over and now you're telling me there are issues."" And many times, how do they tell you that there're issues, to just send a couple of WhatsApp pictures or some random images. It can be a bit dubious in that sense because you don't really know exactly where those images come from, or which box they're talking about, et cetera, etcetera. So that just creates a lot more confusion for the suppliers and at the end of the day, just to save the relationship with the buyer, and to ensure that their networks into those markets are stable, they will absorb those costs. But as you know, once you keep on absorbing those costs, it adds up to your bottom line.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:Yeah, and especially now with COVID, it's not like you could go visit and say, ""Show me what happened."" So that's really interesting. So when you go to make a sale, like you go to a supplier and is that kind of what you lead with? You say, ""This will help you handle those disputes."" Is that the main selling point?
Adrian Teo, DiMuto:Well it really depends on what our suppliers, or rather our customers, are looking for. So many times they might explain to us that, ""Hey, they don't have a traceability system."" So then we come in and say, ""Hey, here's a food package traceability system that's on a blockchain and we connect to the others on networks as well."" But then there are customers who come here and say, ""Hey, you know what, I've got issues with trade disputes, can you help us solve that?"" Now there's another service that we do provide, which is really a value added service, as a result of being able to see very clearly the data points within your trade. And that's actually the financial services aspect.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:Oh.
Adrian Teo, DiMuto:So for example, I just got off a call yesterday with a new sort of company that sells blueberries and strawberries out of South Africa. Really awesome branding, really awesome marketing strategies that they have employed. But really new company, although they have 20, 30 years of experience in that industry, collectively. But they are at the stage where they really want to breakout of just the South African market into the global markets. Either, is it in China or Southeast Asia. But they don't have the working capital to do that. Right. And as well all know, we're all tied down to your end customers payment terms. Which can be prohibitive sometimes, actually all the time, in doing more business. Right?
Adrian Teo, DiMuto:So I can speak just for Singapore and Southeast Asia, typically we get in excess of 30 or 45 days upon arrival, in terms of payment terms. And that's something that many of the suppliers worldwide in Europe, in Americas, aren't too happy about, unless you have an ongoing and longstanding sort of relationship. And because of those long payment cycles, your working capital is locked up. And when it's locked up, you face a lot of issues trying to grow and breakout and compete with your other competitors in that market as well. Now then layer on issues like trade disputes and claim issues, on top of that, and you can imagine your payment cycles are just going to get extended way beyond the 30 or 45 days.
Adrian Teo, DiMuto:So where DiMuto comes in, is that we're able to help you digitalize your trade from farm to the table. The entire documentation level, product level, have that all visible on the platform. Some of this information are part of the blockchain, so that we can ensure transparency and trust. But the beautiful thing about having your information digitalized on the platform now, is that we invite financing companies, supply chain factory companies, credit insurance companies, to come in to reduce the risk involved from a payment default, for example. And then we finance, either the supplier or the buyer. Right. So something like, if we finance the supplier, what we will do is we would ensure that your products are tracked, we send those information to the financing company. The moment your goods arrive in good condition at the buyer's location, up to 70-80% of the entire trade value will be paid to you upfront. Right. So Vonnie, can you imagine what that would do for your business, if you're able to now unlock up to 80% of that trade value within the next day and then roll that over for more trades.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:It's a great service. You mentioned a number of different regions and countries. What is your global footprint? How many different countries are you working in?
Adrian Teo, DiMuto:I think we are close to at least ten countries. I can roll it off like a rap if you want me to.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:Sure, go ahead. I'm sure they're at the top of your head.
Adrian Teo, DiMuto:Southeast Asia of course. Singapore, Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand. We're trying to make en routes into Vietnam right now, and the Philippines, we have a footprint there. And then East Asia, so in China, Taiwan, South Korea and Japan. So we are really strong in that East/Southeast Asia aspects.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:Mm-hmm (affirmative).
Adrian Teo, DiMuto:But we're also, from a supplier standpoint, we have suppliers from Latin America, so we have Mexico, Columbia, Peru, Chile. Now we're trying to tap into Brazil as well, huge market there.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:Yes.
Adrian Teo, DiMuto:And then talking about the Pacific region, we've got Australia. Then moving West, we've got Africa, so South Africa. We're now doing a pilot of soybeans in Ghana, so that's exciting. And then interestingly, we are also now doing flowers out of Holland. So we are shipping flowers from Kenya to Holland and then onwards to the rest of Western or Eastern European countries. And then yeah, UK for sure.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:Mm-hmm (affirmative). So this episode that I'm doing right now is on Singapore and looking at Singapore companies and trying to help the rest of the world understand what it's like to be a business in Singapore. So why did you start your company there in Singapore? What was the reason to start there? Because you were all there? Or were there other reasons?
Adrian Teo, DiMuto:Yeah Vonnie, I think that is the first and foremost reason perhaps. That we're all Singaporeans, Gary the founder, runs and is still part of the board of a fruits trading company based in Singapore as well, and that's sort of the natural progression for us to continue being in Singapore. But I think beyond this obvious reason as well, I think Singapore is a great place to start, especially an agtech company. Anything related to technology, and that's really because of the sort of ecosystem that the Singapore government has really built over the past few decades, to support such innovations to happen around here. So it's not just from a financial standpoint, where they give those supports in the form of grants, or funds that we can tap into. But even the professional support, the intellectual support that happens around here, especially in Singapore, is something that is very attractive for us to remain in.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:These three conversations are like dropping into what a good ecosystem can bring to a sector. Government support, private sector financing, smart entrepreneurs, with all areas willing to take risks to support growth. I love that Singapore is both working at developing food for itself and also as Benny says, developing technology for the rest of the world as well.

Be ready to take notes! This episode covers the needs of the food supply chain which was pushed into the spotlight by COVID-19. As we saw shortages on the shelf, and supply disruption and dislocations in production and distribution, this complicated question arose: What does it take to get data flowing from farm to plate to resiliently manage the supply chain? Brita and Seana have previously covered the well-funded ends of the supply chain. Seana in AgTech and Brita in Foodtech. They believe there is tremendous, untapped opportunity for vertical-specific technology companies which are focused on serving the unique needs of the food supply chain. After listening to this episode, you will to!

Vonnie Estes, PMA:Welcome to PMA Takes on Tech. The podcast that explores the problems, solutions, people, and ideas that are shaping the future of the produce industry. I'm your host, Vonnie Estes, vice president of technology for the Produce Marketing Association. And I've spent years in the ag tech sector. So I can attest, it's hard to navigate this ever-changing world and developing and adopting new solutions to industry problems. Thanks for joining us and for allowing us to serve as your guide to the new world of produce and technology. My goal of the podcast is to outline a problem in the produce industry and then discuss several possible solutions that can be deployed today.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:Stout Industrial Technology collaborates with customers to build and launch industrial technology solutions that are designed to last. The Smart Cultivator combines a proprietary agriculturally proven mechanical platform with Stout true vision technology to eliminate weeds and cultivate ground in a single pass. Visit Stoutagtech.com that's S-T-O-U-T-A-G-T-E-C-H.com to learn more.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:If you were anywhere in the food supply chain from producer to retailer food service, you're going to love this episode. Also, if you are a tech provider or investor in the food supply chain, you should listen up. I talk with Seana Day and Brita Rosenheim of Culterra Capital about their landscape of the supply chain and the trends that they're seeing. Most of the investments to date, have been focused at either end of the supply chain, either in ag tech or food tech. This landscape focuses on everything it takes to get food from post-harvest to retail, get ready to take notes. They talk about the four pillars of the supply chain and the seven innovation drivers. We also discuss why this is the time for investment in the supply chain and the difference technology can make. Let's jump into the conversation.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:Brita and Shauna, it's so great to have you on the podcast. As you know, I'm such a big fan of your work. You recently published your supply chain tech landscape 2021, which is a masterpiece view of the industry. You've also laid out trends and the importance of investing in the supply chain now. For those of you listening, who are near a computer or your phone, you can Google Culterra Capital and open up the landscape. We'll talk about it later, but before we get to that, let's get to some background. So tell me about who you are and a little bit about how you got there and you're focus on the supply chain.
Seana Day, Culterra Capital:Thanks very much, Vonnie. It's great to be with you. I'm Seana Day and I'll give Brita Rosenheim a chance to introduce herself in just a second, but I'll jump in first. And just give you a little bit of background about the journey and how we kind of got here. So I've historically covered ag tech and some of your audience members might've seen the farm tech and ag tech landscapes we've published for the last five or six years. And we really look at that through the lens of IT for food and ag. So we're looking at software, hardware applications, and I think I cover at this stage about 1,600 companies, that's probably growing on a global basis. And so this was really a fun opportunity for Brita and I to do some collaboration as we look into the messy middle of food and ag, but just kind of by way of background.
Seana Day, Culterra Capital:I sit in the Central Valley in California. So I'm based in Turlock. And this was kind of a natural extension for me to look into the supply chain, given that kind of ag background and the ag roots. And not only that, in California, it's a $200 billion food processing industry, and a lot of that takes place in the Central Valley as well. So this has kind of been a passion of mine, since I moved back to my hometown about seven years ago, and really spent more and more time thinking about not only what's happening in the farm, in the field, but also the value add. The food processing, manufacturing and a lot of the logistics. So I'll kick it over to Brita, to give a little bit of her background.
Brita Rosenheim:Thanks, Seana. Yep, this is Brita Rosenheim. So for me, it was also a natural extension going upwards. Historically, over the last decade, I've focused on technologies that are supporting the retail, CPG and restaurant sectors. So obviously they're very tied to the supply chain and over the many years, I've spent time looking at pockets of supply chain, but I think COVID really an earth and opportunity for us to roll up our sleeves, connect our worlds, and really understand the different technologies associated with the different value chains across the food supply chain. So really great timing.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:Great. Thanks. So please define for us what supply chain means to you and remember that many of my listeners are in the produce industry. So how do you define supply chain?
Seana Day, Culterra Capital:Yeah, I mean, I think we spent a lot of time actually thinking about how we position it, how we define it as we were creating the landscape itself. So we'll unpack a little bit of that later on in the conversation, but kind of fundamentally, we see the supply chain in four kind of pillars, if you will. First mile, so that's basically what's happening from the farm gate to the first packer, shipper processor or primary processor, the first kind of handoff. The second pillar is really around production and food manufacturing value add. The third in our view would be around distribution logistics, and then the fourth would be kind of demand, so really what's happening closest to the retailer or the food service provider. Really, that kind of loading dock.
Seana Day, Culterra Capital:And then, Brita's kind of world picks up within the walls of the retailer food service and looking at food tech, but that's really how we've kind of approached the supply chain as it were. And then as we thought about, what are some of the innovation drivers within that supply chain? We really got pretty deep over the course of 2020. Looking at seven different distinct innovation value drivers. Strategy and analytics, so really thinking about how to improve responses to changing the dynamics and kind of internal shocks as we saw in 2020, but just internal considerations. Whether it's weather, trade, labor disputes, what's happening on the ground. We looked at planning and execution.
Seana Day, Culterra Capital:So how do we create an environment of more responsive operations, better forecasting, better planning. We looked at asset utilization. I think this is a particularly interesting one as we start to think about load planning and transportation and logistics, and co-packers. How do people use their assets and how can technology improve the use of those assets in a more productive and profitable way? Of course, labor is something that's near and dear to I'm sure most of your audience's ears and hearts in this topic. As an innovation driver, we really believe that labor is going to be a key influencer in terms of adoption of automation and technology, but not only that, just worker safety as well. So what kinds of tools and technologies can be applied to improving worker safety.
Seana Day, Culterra Capital:Of course, quality and food safety is another key innovation driver that we looked at in the supply chain. And that's really thinking about how you decrease FSQ, food safety and quality costs. Costs to comply and report to monitor. How do you mitigate those risks, food, safety, risks in particular? And our produce listeners would probably really identify with kind of more real-time technologies and more real-time tools to help mitigate food safety risks. And then of course, extending shelf life. And we've seen some really interesting innovative technologies there.
Seana Day, Culterra Capital:The sixth pillar, is really thinking about vendor and order management and in our case, grower management. So how do you kind of digitize some of those back-office processes and improve ability to collaborate among supply chain partners? And then finally, as a key innovation driver, the physical flow of goods. How do you increase visibility into the cold chain? How do you reduce transportation costs? How do you reduce penalties and rejections from the retailers with sort of track and trace technology and reporting technologies? So that's a long-winded way of saying how we think about the supply chain, but that's how we've defined it in the landscape and then thought about investment opportunities and innovation opportunities across the supply chain.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:Wow, there's a lot in that. That could be a whole another fruitful conversation.
Seana Day, Culterra Capital:We'll come back some day and talk about that.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:Yeah. That can only be spoken by someone who has really dissected this and looked at it very closely. So we'll dig deeper into some of that. So value creation to date has been consolidated at the end points of food and ag, as you were talking about. So growing and harvesting at one end, where there's been a lot of technologies developed and a lot of money invested in ag tech on that side, which is Seana, what you've worked on a lot and then retail and food service, kind of at the other side. There's been a lot of investment and technology development, which Brita you've worked on a lot. So why do you think this is the time for investment in the supply chain and how has COVID accelerated this need?
Brita Rosenheim:Sure. I'll take that one. In doing this work, even ahead of COVID, we are reaching a unique inflection point in the evolution of the food supply chain. We do think that there's growing agreement and understanding by food supply chain stakeholders, that they can no longer put off investment into technology. So we're seeing increasing digital readiness, obviously spurred by COVID, supply chain dislocations, but we're also seeing new innovation from the tech companies, themselves, new tech breakthroughs that are focused on the new ... Excuse me, focused on the unique nuances of today's food industry. Some of that again, pre COVID existed, post COVID exacerbated. These shifting consumer preferences, the tremendous increase in omni-channel, that's putting greater pressure on suppliers to adopt to the dynamic demands of the buyers.
Brita Rosenheim:Of course, we're seeing, as Seana referenced, acute labor shortages, that's driving the need for automation. And taking a step back, we're looking at market and investor demands for increased traceability and sustainability. So those are some of the key drivers that were percolating ahead of COVID, but I think we've really sharpened the focus of the different participants across the supply chain and recognized that there is urgency that that technology can address.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:Yeah. And I think with COVID ... Before, COVID most Americans didn't even consider the food supply chain, they had never even thought of it, because food always showed up. And so I think it certainly has put some consumer focus on it as well.
Brita Rosenheim:Yep, yep.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:So what part does digitalization play? And can you give some examples of that?
Brita Rosenheim:Certainly. Yeah. So just building that, we're seeing this increased recognition that accumulated technical debt is unsustainable in the supply chain. Right now, the supply chain tech category is highly fragmented. We're seeing a lot of legacy or very specialized or highly customized and of horizontal edge enterprise tech solutions. And so that's what we're dealing with. Digitalization exists, but we're looking, how do we take it to the next level and create interoperability across those solutions? So we're seeing kind of clear venture opportunities to develop. We think vertical plays and strategy and analytics, robotics, automation, specialized distribution and logistics players. All of those rely on unsiloed data, you're connecting systems across the supply chain, but we're also seeing artificial intelligence, machine learning, IOT and other advancements that are driving tech into more complex physical spaces. And so that's, factories, roads, warehouses, farms, where historically we didn't have a lot of technology.
Brita Rosenheim:And so, that's paving the way for a broader digitalized platform foundation. For example, the function of vendor and order management. We know Excel and email, they're the king of supply chain applications still to date, but there's increasing adoption for business automation, process automation software, it helps operators in the first mile and in retail, digitize those back office functions like document processing, payments. RPA, robotic process automation. There are a number of different technologies that are helping to create an underlying digital foundation to the supply chain.
Brita Rosenheim:Ultimately, that supports increased collaboration, internal and external, better data quality, better insights. Ultimately, optimize procurement processes for the retailers because they have better insights, better predictive processes. And we think that it has a potential to reduce overall time to market and that's particularly important, obviously in the fresh and perishable space.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:You mentioned interoperability, which is an issue across the whole supply chain on farm, all the way through to retailer. And so how do you think about that and how do you think that's going to play out, because right now it seems like there's so many different systems and they don't speak to each other.
Seana Day, Culterra Capital:When we started this project, this Odyssey last year. I really started to fixate on this idea of, so what? So if, you have more data, how would that have changed some of the massive dislocations that we saw in the food supply chain? And a few that come to my mind, just based on where I sit. We saw dairy processors kind of shut down overnight because they may have been servicing the food service industry. And all of a sudden, they didn't need 20 pound totes of mozzarella anymore. And then you'd see milk, dairy producers then having to dump milk in their fields. And that kind of dislocation, I think really hit people hard. But getting back to that question, I ask myself, ""So what, if we would have had more data, how would that have changed that outcome?""
Seana Day, Culterra Capital:And that's kind of got us to sort of pull on this sweater, thread of data interoperability and how data flows through the supply chain to kind of start. The more we pulled on it, the more things kind of unraveled as we were trying to get to some of these answers. You kind of have to unpack what the data is. Is it specs, is it traceability data? Is that food safety data? What is the data that needs to get passed from one hand to the next. We kind of think about it in two ways. You've got what exists within the four walls. And a lot of that's going to be your production data, your manufacturing execution systems, things that you need to operate the business within the four walls. But then you've got to share some of that selected data with your supply chain partners as well.
Seana Day, Culterra Capital:And as we started to map out those data flows, which we did sort of an agonizing level of detail to get to some of those so what answers, then we kind of sort of backed ourselves out of it and said, ""Okay, so what are some of those adoption headwinds?"" In terms of getting people to share data or adopt digital technologies to kind of aid in the sharing of data And Brita, mentioned one, which I think is a real sort of struggle and pain point, and that's that Excel and email sort of remain the defacto technology standards in many industries. It's not unique to food and ag, but we certainly see that in food and ag.
Seana Day, Culterra Capital:We struggle with data quality. There's a lot of sort of manual entry. You write something down in the field or out on the loading dock. And you've got to give a piece of paper to somebody in the office who transcribes it. Functional silos, that's another. We understand the pain of functional silos and decision-making well now. I think if you're talking to an FSQ manager, procurement manager, a transportation manager, they might have different pain points and the same solution is not going to necessarily solve their individual pain points. I think probably one of the biggest that either you and your audience may identify with, is really change management or sort of incremental improvement or process improvement. However, you want to call it, getting people to change the way that they've always done things is really, really difficult, and it takes leadership and capacity building. And the technology has to be easy to use. And there has to be a short learning curve.
Seana Day, Culterra Capital:These are all, I think, learnings that the technology companies and the business leaders are probably struggling with, but hopefully we sort of get over that inflection point and we start to see more of that commitment to digitalizing businesses and not sort of trying to do everything all at once, but really having a sort of long-term strategy for implementing technologies. And also, recognizing that the ROI of tech starts to come when you can combine some of these systems and data sets. So having kind of reasonable expectations for ROI in one system versus a kind of systems, of systems, where you really start to hum in terms of the decision support, but it doesn't happen overnight.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:Yeah. I was listening to this South by Southwest virtual conference presentation a couple of weeks ago, and it was a guy talking about how now every company is a software company and it was very compelling. And them talking about, all the tools that you need to be using just to do business right now, you better have people oriented around how things connect. How does data gets get passed through? So I think that's going to be a big change in our industry, along with every industry. So let's-
Brita Rosenheim:Just building on that one particular point is, I think that's where we're seeing the opportunity, especially at the venture side. As I mentioned, you have a lot of legacy systems, but we're seeing an increase of software SaaS, in early stage companies that are using AI and machine learning to better harmonize data from legacy systems. So they're straddling the existing systems. You don't have to rip and replace, but they're integrating them to better optimize for real-time planning, visibility by pulling from multiple systems. So you're going to be a modern lens. And this is also another driver, one other driver I'd say is, consumerization of enterprise tech. You're getting those kind of modern user experiences and pulling this data from lots of legacy systems in order to make better decisions. And so in the strategy analysis piece, that's where we think there's a lot of opportunity for earlier stage teams to help move the needle there.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:Yeah. They were also talking about, just making the decision of, do you build or buy? What systems are out there like, AWS, that you don't have to build everything yourself, but what can you kind of plug everything into? For a company that doesn't normally use those systems, just integration of everything is going to be a challenge as well.
Brita Rosenheim:Certainly. Yep.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:Yep. Seana, you and I've had this conversation a little bit before about the first mile, but let's kind of open it up again to talk about, what happens at first mile and what happens there right after harvesting has one of the biggest effects on produce quality and shelf life. So what do you see as the important technologies and innovations that are coming there and are needed there in the first mile?
Seana Day, Culterra Capital:Yeah. I mean, Brita's sitting in New York right now and I'm in California and I can probably hear her eyes rolling back in her head because I talk about first mile so much, I'm obsessed with it. Every time I get on the phone with somebody and I have a chance to talk about first mile or ask questions. I do. So I'd love to answer this question. Again, when we started unpacking this, I did a lot of work just to kind of understand what actually happens in the first mile, what data is collected? From harvest and sort of labor planning, harvest planning, harvest equipment planning, actually harvesting, the harvest activities themselves. To then kind of load scheduling, load logistics. Once it sort of leaves the field, then looking at receiving, grading, QA, QC, how are the commodities stored? And then how are they marketed and how are they sold? And the shipping logistics from that point.
Seana Day, Culterra Capital:And then also within that first mile umbrella, and you'll see this on the landscape, is really that grower contract management, grower management. So that's where the payments, the certifications are really, the sort of tools and technologies to keep records there. So that's a lot, those are a lot of kind of discreet moving pieces that obviously have a lot of dependencies on one another as well. There's a whole bunch of different data sets that go along with those different activities. And by data sets, they don't necessarily go into a computer. They are on a notebook somewhere, or they sit in a dispatcher's head, who's worked on sort of load planning and transportation logistics for 20 years. That's the area of the first mile that I'm really excited about, but really, I think we have a long way to go in terms of digitalization.
Seana Day, Culterra Capital:This is probably the least digitized part of our sort of supply chain as we've defined it. I think a lot of the activity that at least I've seen as we've done a lot of the company research is really in that producer management, grower contracts. There are sort of workflows and task management activities there that plug into food safety and quality, and they plug into some of the other traceability applications that we're increasingly seeing more and more demand for. And then of course, you have monitoring also, as you mentioned. And we've talked about, what happens in that first mile is so important from a quality and shelf life standpoint. You might think that the cut to cool time is three hours or five hours, and it might be taking nine hours. Once, you kind of look at the monitoring technologies. Those are just some of the areas that there appears to be a lot of opportunity for technology intervention and better monitoring, reporting, and management of relationships and contracts.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:So let's switch to the landscape that you've done. And so this is such an amazing piece of work. And so those of you that can open this, it's Culterra Capital, and you can open and look in the landscape. I realize that probably some people listening to this are either driving or folding laundry. So you might want to open it up later and look at it. But can you at a high level then walk us through kind of the backbone of the landscape. One of the things I found the most interesting about it, was just how you even segmented everything. It was like looking into both of your brains to see how you think. The way that you even segmented it because that in itself was an amazing piece of work. So how did you break up the different sections and then how did you find the companies and kind of populate it?
Seana Day, Culterra Capital:Brita and I spent most ... As many people in the world know, we didn't travel very much in 2020. So we had a chance to really go deep and in an undistracted sort of very focused way. And we realized probably about midway through that we had bit off a lot more than we could chew, but that was a challenge for us that we happily embraced. This took us a long time to kind of figure out how to organize and not only organize the pillars, the supply side production and manufacturing, distribution, logistics, and demand. But also really thinking about, ""Okay, who's doing more strategy work, who's doing more just the blocking and tackling execution and then who are those kind of more value chain players that really crossover?"" And the first kind of, I guess, qualifications I'd say. We fully recognize that there are many companies on this landscape that could fit into multiple categories.
Seana Day, Culterra Capital:So we had conversations with them to try to figure out what the predominant business model was. We had to make some judgment calls there. And then the other thing that I would say is, I want ... Brita, wouldn't know exactly the number I'm sure, but I think we've got about 3 or 400 logos. We came up with about 650 companies in the database, and we really approached this in the same way that we approach our respective landscapes, mine on the ag tech side, Brita on the food tech. We do just a lot of research. We have our own proprietary databases. We talked to a large number of companies, which is great, about these maps. It gives us a chance to get to know, where the really exciting innovators are. And we love that part of our work.
Seana Day, Culterra Capital:It was new to us and a lot of these companies are also more horizontal, especially if we look at the production and logistics and distribution. Food and ag might be a vertical that they have a footprint in, that was kind of a criteria for us. Every company on this landscape has a footprint in food and ag, although many are horizontal. And that was really how we started to kind of come up with this thesis of, ""Okay, now is the time. It feels like we are in that moment where verticalized food and ag specific, food and bev specific technologies are really going to advance the modernization of the food supply chain."" And again, we look back at the massive dislocations that we saw in the supply chain in 2020. And that sense of urgency I think, is really sort of creating an interesting moment for us.
Seana Day, Culterra Capital:And we're excited to get to know, and we'll shortly make our announcement in a first mile investment that we've made in the last couple of weeks. So we're really excited to support the companies that are looking at building these food and ag specific data sets to address some of these supply chain challenges.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:When I look at that landscape and that's so many really smart people and a bunch of money that's gone into it and great technology that's being directed to the supply chain. I think people wouldn't realize that, that's happening without you really shining a light on it.
Seana Day, Culterra Capital:Yeah. I mean, the other thing that we did, and you touched on this earlier. The investment has really sort of gathered around the end points, Food tech and ag tech, and here we see a lot of internal R&D. You've got mature companies here that sort of obviously reinvest. So we're not talking about outside investment. I fully understand that there's great R&D that's done, but if you actually look at the venture and private equity investment in the kind of messy middle here, it is sort of surprisingly low given the size of the prize. We kind of call this $150 billion opportunity and the proportion of outside risk capital and outside investment that's flowed into the spaces, is surprisingly low given the size of that prize.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:Do you think that's because people don't see it as an opportunity or don't know how to attack it? Or now that you've kind of broke it open, you think people are going to rush in. Why isn't there more money flowing into there?
Seana Day, Culterra Capital:Look, food processing isn't very sexy. We hope that, that changes. We hope that as people start to understand the really interesting work that's being done around food safety detection. Freshness control application, there are some really interesting opportunities to move the needle significantly. Particularly, when we talk about these big picture challenges, like food waste. Everybody talks about food waste. Well, here's a place where we can deploy capital to really move the needle and kind of improve the metrics around food waste, for example.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:You all have identified five trends that will accelerate tech adoption. Can you kind of go through some of those and highlight what you see are the important trends?
Seana Day, Culterra Capital:Yeah. So I'll start and Brita and I can both speak to this. On the supply side and this applies across the board, but really operational visibility. As I mentioned before, the first mile is kind of the least digitized part of the food supply chain. So increasing that level of the digitalization. Tech enabled resource and asset planning, I think that's really going to be an important trend to watch as we look at ... Just anecdotally, I drive around in my part of the valley and I'll drive by a field every couple of miles where you see 20 empty trailers or 30 empty trailers, and you kind of scratch your head and think, ""Wow, I wonder if there's a way to better utilize or optimize the CapEx that's gone into those 20 or 30 empty trailers."" So really using technology to improve resource planning and allocation.
Seana Day, Culterra Capital:And then the other area that we kind of looked at, and you'll see this on the map is, sort of data-driven market insights. What kind of data and information can marketers, can traders use to reduce volatility, to reduce risk, to reduce loss across the supply chain? I think there's a lot of neat work that should be done and will continue to appear on the horizon around just those market insights. And then I'll also speak to the production piece, the food manufacturing piece. I think really thinking about industry 4.0 readiness and Brita, touched on it earlier. How do a lot of these food manufacturing plants or value add plants really react to those industry 4.0 innovations that are coming down the pipeline to improve automation, to improve worker safety, to reduce dependency on workers in some lines? And then also to be able to provide ...
Seana Day, Culterra Capital:We haven't talked very much about it, I don't know what number to use, you can use anywhere between 30 and 60,000 food processors in the US alone. And there are obviously the very large ones that we've seen and heard a lot about, but the S&Bs, the small to midsize food processing, food, manufacturing facilities, and plants really don't have the same sort of end-to-end operational platforms that some of the big guys have. It's going to be exciting, I think, to see more of those types of kind of end to end technology solutions that can help those S&Bs focus on productivity and profitability in their businesses. So I'll kick it over to Brita, to talk about a couple of the others.
Brita Rosenheim:Yeah. And building on that, looking at the logistics and distribution piece, which straddles the entire supply chain. One trend in particular that we're seeing in food and ag, but broadly, is supply chain as a service. So layering in better intelligent logistics and distribution options and not necessarily managing it all within house. So just in the same way that cloud computing has allowed companies to reduce their upfront CapEx, supply chain as a service is helping companies across the supply chain augment their procurement, their production control, their manufacturing, quality, warehousing, logistics. Outsourcing that, where it makes more sense to leverage companies that are specializing in those functions. That obviously helps, especially on the earlier stage side. It helps S&Bs get up to scale quickly, leveraging these other technologies.
Brita Rosenheim:Another piece of that, in terms of intelligent logistics and distribution is layering robotics, so human robot collaboration. So where in DCs and fulfillment centers, we're seeing increased robotics. Some are autonomous, but increasingly we're seeing that relationship between humans and robotic solutions or AR, VR in terms of training. We're seeing that middleware, the software systems that are supporting the operations and the workers within the warehouses. I think that's generally a category that's been horizontal. And as we're seeing this increase in horizontal software, so looking at multiple industries, and as we're seeing the shift towards increased eCommerce, digital grocery ordering. We're going to see increase solutions that are focused on the fresh and perishable category in terms of robotics and automation at the warehouse and DC center. Obviously, they're focused on how do you fulfill at the quantity and speed that you need in order to make eCommerce profitable?
Brita Rosenheim:Going a little further down the supply chain to demand, looking at these actual retail and restaurant businesses themselves. We're seeing a huge urgency for last mile economies of scale. How do you actually get it to the consumer? And increased focus on inventory management, demand planning, distribution. How do you upgrade your processes there to better react to the consumer demands and these new business and revenue models? Whether it's direct to consumer, omni-channel or the cook and collect options. Obviously, on the restaurant side, which we haven't talked about more, you're not in business, if you didn't adopt a digital interface and online ordering and curbside pickup at a minimum during this past year.
Brita Rosenheim:We've seen a huge jump in terms of, kind of technical adoption through Instacart, whether it's the large third-party marketplaces, not all of it's done in house, but helping these restaurants and retailers adopt to these new purchasing behaviors. So I think that's changing kind of business model approach on the demand side. And then, just broadly we're looking at ... If you're looking at taking a step back at the entire value chain, all of these lead to hopefully a tighter and better connection between supply and demand. Now that's the Holy Grail. And Vonnie, you had mentioned ahead of this, when were preparing for it. There's little visibility between the warehouse and the point of sale. Where's my stuff? Where's my stuff going to? We still have very siloed data and a number of technical gaps to fill there. So ultimately, all of these technologies should be supporting a better connection between supply and demand in terms of visibility.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:Yeah. I think that's definitely what the industry needs. You look at that landscape and you think, ""Okay, that's what it's going to take."" All right. Well, Brita and Seana, this has been an incredible conversation and I always learn so much from both of you. And I think you have one of the best views of what's happening in this whole middle piece. And I hope that, that drives your investment and also other people's investment into this sector, because it really supports the whole food industry. So thank you very much for the work that you do and for spending this time with us today.
Seana Day, Culterra Capital:Thanks for having us, Vonnie.
Brita Rosenheim:Absolutely, our pleasure. Thank you.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:That's it for this episode of PMA Takes on Tech. Thanks for allowing us to serve as your guide to the new world of produce and technology. Be sure to check out all our episodes at Pma.com and wherever you get

The challenge: Sustainability is on consumers’ minds, but mixed signals on terminology, safety perceptions and packaging trade offs keep eco friendly produce from fully taking root.
The International Fresh Produce Association surveyed 754 U.S. consumers to explore how sustainability considerations shape produce purchases and to identify actionable strategies that drive both sustainable choices and sales. This section explores local sourcing, packaging impact and eco friendly claims, highlighting opportunities for clear labeling, traceable origin stories and packaging innovation to meet expectations and expand market share.
Sustainability in Mind, But Selectively
Just over half of shoppers consider growing methods and packaging materials when buying produce.
The Opportunity: Elevate clear, certified sustainability claims (organic, recyclable, low pesticide) on front of pack and in store signage.
Local Commands a Premium
Nearly three quarters of consumers are willing to pay more for locally grown produce.
The Opportunity: Spotlight local sourcing through “Farm to Table” labels, regional branding and dedicated shelf sections.
Packaging: Premium vs. Perceived Waste
Almost half of consumers would pay extra for sustainable packaging, yet many still view packaging itself as unnecessary.
The Opportunity: Introduce minimal waste packs that balance protection, and clearly articulate the value of each packaging feature.
Terminology Confusion
Only 20% of Americans understand advanced sustainability terms like carbon farming or climate smart ag—though these buzzwords influence purchase decisions
The Opportunity: Simplify sustainability language with easy scan QR codes, in store info cards and straightforward icons that explain practices in plain English.
Perceived Quality Up
Perceived quality of sustainably produced items has increased in 2024 compared to 2023.
The Opportunity: Spotlight quality, taste, and freshness on packaging of sustainable produced items to further increase consumer preferences for these products.
Quick Wins for Produce Marketers
Launch a “Locally Grown” campaign with premium shelf tags.
Roll out eco minimal packaging piloted in high traffic stores.
Deploy QR codes to educate on sustainability terms.
Feature sustainability “storyboards” in digital ads and social channels.

PFAS in Specialty Crop Production
Share

Key takeaways:
A family of compounds known as PFAS are recognized by regulatory agencies worldwide as a contaminant
PFAS are ubiquitous in households (non-stick cookware, some microwave-safe single-use containers, certain wrinkle-free and stain-free textiles and surface treatments) and in the environment (jet fuel, grease-resistant coatings, firefighting foam).
Repeated FDA supermarket surveys of fresh produce detected either no or only traces of PFAS in fresh produce. Commonly found in shellfish, seafood, some ultra-processed foods.
Soils and ag water in production areas located away from PFAS manufacturing facilities, airports, large urban areas are generally free from PFAS
Common sources of PFAS contamination (biosolids, urban run-off) are already excluded from specialty crop production for FSMA compliance
Executive summary
Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are a large and diverse class of over 12,000 synthetic compounds, recognized as environmental contaminants of concern due to their persistence and potential health risks (National Academy of Sciences, 2022). PFAS can enter the environment through three main pathways--emissions from manufacturing facilities, landfill leachate, and discharges from wastewater treatment plants. Human exposure primarily occurs via ingestion, inhalation, and dermal contact, with ingestion of contaminated food and water being the most common route. Inhalation of dust or airborne PFAS and dermal contact with certain products also contribute to overall exposure. Global regulatory framework aiming to exclude PFAS from foods, waters and the environment is rapidly evolving.
PFAS are ubiquitous and used in thousands of consumer and industrial products, including nonstick cookware, firefighting foams, jet fuel, and protective gear. A review of 52 studies that examined 15 categories of consumer products—encompassing 1,040 individual items—identified 107 distinct PFAS (Dewapriya et al., 2023). PFAS concentrations in consumer products varied widely, ranging from 0.26 parts per trillion (ppt) to 29,000 parts per million (ppm). The highest average concentrations were detected in textiles, followed by household chemicals, then cosmetics. Firefighting products exhibited the highest mean PFAS concentration, with 39 products showing an average of 488.51 ppm (range: 0.11–11,031.30 ppm) (Benotti et al., 2020; Favreau et al., 2017a, 2017b; Fiedler et al., 2010; Herzke et al., 2012; Weiner et al., 2013). Textile finishing agents reported a mean concentration of 302.92 ppm (range: 2.92–1,370.00 ppm) across 12 products (Mumtaz et al., 2019). Ten studies evaluating household chemicals—covering 122 products—had an aggregated mean PFAS concentration of 208.08 ppm (range: 0.0005–3,490.60 ppm) (Blom and Hanssen, 2015; Borg, 2017; Favreau et al., 2017a, 2017b; Fiedler et al., 2010; Guo et al., 2009; Herzke et al., 2012; Kotthoff et al., 2015; Liu et al., 2014, 2015).
FDA repeated sampling of fruit and vegetable samples from retail outlets detected either no PFAS at all or only low traces of PFAS over the 4-year sampling period (2019-2023). Foods of animal origin, on the other hand, were an important contributor to human exposure to PFAS based on the same survey.  Fish and shellfish can accumulate PFAS from polluted waters, making them a notable dietary source. Similarly, animals that graze on contaminated land or drink tainted water may accumulate PFAS in their meat and in dairy products. Drinking water can also become contaminated through leaching from landfills, industrial sites, and other polluted areas.
While biosolids (treated sewage sludge) are often contaminated with PFAS and can contaminate soils, the use of biosolids in horticulture is already limited because of grower’s intent to comply with FSMA.  In the soils that did not experience recent biosolid deposition or a run-off from highly contaminated sites, levels of PFAS are very low (although academic studies detected very low levels of PFAS in remote areas).  Under laboratory conditions, there is evidence of PFAS uptake by plants.

The challenge: While fruits and vegetables remain a must have on most grocery lists, price sensitivity, ambivalence toward packaging, and low brand loyalty mean many shoppers tweak or skip purchases, highlighting actionable strategies for the produce industry.
The International Fresh Produce Association surveyed 754 U.S. consumers to uncover the realities of shopping for fresh fruits and vegetables—how price, packaging and brand influence choices, and which tactics can drive purchases. These findings help the industry refine pricing tiers, innovate packaging features, and tailor messaging to consumer expectations, ultimately driving stronger engagement and higher produce sales.
Price Perception & Action
Most American shoppers see produce prices as fair, although 60% would pay more for quality. Budget pressures still drive most to cut back, with only 30% saying they wouldn’t change their habits if prices rose.
The Opportunity: Highlight value for dollar messaging, tiered pricing, “quality guaranteed” and limited time offers to reassure budget minded shoppers.
Value Added Formats Gain Traction
Nearly 40% of consumers respond to high prices by opting for fresh cut or added value produce (pre washed, portioned, ready to eat).
The Opportunity: Expand and promote mix and match bundles, snack packs and meal kit integrations to meet both cost and convenience needs.
Brand Agnosticism Rules
Produce shoppers are largely brand agnostic, choosing items on price and perceived quality rather than label loyalty.
The Opportunity: Focus on consistent freshness cues (color coding, seal icons) to build trust at shelf.
Packaging Preferences Diverge
46% agree packaging isn’t necessary, yet one third would pay a premium for packaged produce; most buyers rely more on nutrition labels and date codes than on packaging design alone.
The Opportunity: Offer dual lines, minimal, eco friendly packaging alongside premium, informative packs that spotlight nutrition facts, origin stories and extended shelf life.
Quick Wins for Produce Marketers
Clearly label quality and price tiers so shoppers understand what they’re buying.
Scale ready to eat, value added bundles.
Launch a cohesive produce category branding toolkit.
Pilot eco minimal and premium informative packaging with clear date/nutrition callouts.

Microplastics and Nanoplastics in Specialty Crop Production
Share
Tweet
Email
Share
Key Takeaways:
While micro and nanoplastics are ubiquitous in the environment, health agencies worldwide do not link their presence in the environment with a risk to human health.
Micro and nanoplastics are often found in shellfish and other seafoods.
In the US, major sources of microplastics in the production environment (biosolids, urban run-off, heavily contaminated surface waters) are already excluded from fruit and vegetable production for FSMA compliance.
The majority of reports of microplastics in crop production environment are from Asian countries where overall environmental contamination with plastic waste is alarming. Results of these surveys should not be extrapolated to other regions.
Even when present in soils, most microplastics are not taken up by plants. Some nanoplastics that can be taken up by plants were derived from materials like Styrofoam, which is already being phased out.
Executive Summary
Microplastics (MPs) and nanoplastics (NPs) are ubiquitous in the environment and this presence in the environment and in certain foods increasingly draws attention from consumers and regulators. Public health agencies like the US FDA, Health Canada, and the WHO acknowledge the presence of MPs and NPs in the food supply but emphasize that current scientific evidence does not conclusively show a risk to human health. In the United States, the only direct legislation targeting microplastics is the Microbead-Free Waters Act of 2015 (Public Law 114-114), which bans plastic microbeads in rinse-off personal care products. Broader regulation of MPs and NPs in agriculture, food, and water remains limited, although California requires monitoring and formal definitions for microplastics in drinking water. The European Union has taken a more proactive approach, setting a goal to reduce the presence of MPs in the environment by 30% by 2030 through regulatory actions, while still calling for further study on potential health and environmental effects. Currently, there are no established regulatory limits for MPs or NPs in fresh produce, and public health agencies globally have not yet determined whether existing levels pose a significant health risk. In the US, measures put in place under Food Safety Modernization Act (FSMA) and regulations governing USDA Organic Production indirectly limit introduction of MPs and NPs by putting restrictions on uses of certain soil amendments and management of agricultural water.
MPs have been commonly detected in seafood, meat, honey, and sea salt. We note that retail samples of fresh produce have been very limited, collected from local farmers markets. Data obtained from these samples is difficult to meaningfully interpret as the reported values from independent studies differ by ~100,000 fold.  Around the world, plastic particles can be hypothetically introduced into the fresh produce production environment through various routes, including soil amendments, irrigation water, air deposition, and packaging materials. Occurrence and amounts of MPs and NPs in the crop production environment appear to depend on local environmental conditions and production practices, and most well publicized surveys have been carried out in Asia and Europe. Washing produce has been reported to reduce the number of microplastic particles on surfaces.
While field surveys reported the presence of microplastic particles in the field, laboratory studies on the impact of plastic particles on edible plants typically use much smaller nanoparticles (1-1000 nanometer in size). These laboratory reports indicate that under some laboratory conditions, when present in high concentrations in aquatic suspensions, certain nanoparticles can be taken up by plants. However, these studies often use artificially high concentrations or idealized exposure models, or types of plastic particles that are either unlikely to occur in fields or results from plastics that are already being phased out by the industry. Importantly, detecting and measuring MPs and NPs in soil, water, and plant tissue remains technically challenging, with no universally accepted testing standards. As a result, findings from published studies vary widely and should be interpreted with caution.

The challenge: Even though produce drives store choice, shoppers juggle convenience, value perceptions, and family influence, creating friction and missed chances on every trip.
The International Fresh Produce Association surveyed 754 U.S. consumers to understand how store selection criteria, in store experiences and family dynamics shape produce purchases, highlighting clear tactics to capture attention and boost sales.
Store Selection Drivers
Supermarkets dominate as the preferred grocery option, with the produce department ranking highest in choosing a store, followed by convenience and value.
The OpportunityElevate produce’s visibility through strategic cross merchandising and “Produce First” signage.
Power of in-Store Merchandising
In store displays and promotions sway produce purchases more effectively than print ads, online banners or social media.The OpportunityInvest in dynamic merchandising; sampling stations, digital shelf talkers and themed displays to drive impulse buys.
Balancing Value & Convenience
After produce prominence, perceptions of price fairness and ease of shopping rank as key store choice factors.
The OpportunityIntroduce value bundles, grab and go snack packs and quick prep kits positioned near checkout and grab and go aisles.
Family Shopping Influence
58% of children accompany parents most or all of the time, and 40% exert “all” or “a lot” of influence on produce choices.

The challenge: While a majority of Americans ate the same or more produce as last year, serving size confusion and snack for meal routines prevent it from becoming a true daily habit.
The International Fresh Produce Association surveyed 754 U.S. consumers about their fruit and vegetable consumption. Americans are eating more produce than last year, but many are unsure about the required amounts. Snack habits are shifting, and family routines influence food choices. Marketers can help by clarifying serving sizes, offering convenient snacks, and creating family-friendly experiences.
Fresh Leads the Way
Fresh fruits and vegetables make up about half of all produce intake, with canned, frozen, dried, and juice making up the remainder.
The OpportunityIntroduce more on the go options, like pre washed salad kits, snack size packs and easy prep produce to meet consumers’ need for convenience.
Consumption Momentum
95% of Americans report they ate the same or more produce compared to the previous year, signaling sustained engagement.
The OpportunityAmplify positive consumption stories in marketing to reinforce the trend.
Snack & Side Dynamics
66% of adults regularly replace meals with snacks (up from 59% in 2023), and most children’s snacks are not produce.
The OpportunityDevelop ready to eat produce snacks that satisfy meal replacement occasions.
Knowledge Gaps
Consumers underestimate daily recommended servings, believing an average of 3 cups vs the guideline of 4.
The OpportunityUse packaging, labels and digital tools to educate consumers on proper serving sizes.
Meal Pairing Patterns
Produce is most often consumed as a side dish rather than a center of plate component.
The OpportunityPosition produce as the main ingredients in meal kits, bowls and main dish solutions.
Quick Wins for Produce Marketers
Launch bite sized, on the go produce snack packs.
Integrate clear serving guides on front of packaging.
Collaborate on meal kits that showcase produce as the main ingredient.

The challenge: Reaching American consumers who want to eat healthier but don't always follow through.
The International Fresh Produce Association surveyed 754 U.S. consumers to uncover how Americans think about healthy eating - and how their actions often tell a different story. While the desire to eat well is strong, habits don't always follow.
The study reveals a growing openness to ""food as medicine,"" shifting trust toward physicians over social media, and new dynamics driven by GLP-1 medications. These insights offer fresh opportunities for produce marketers to align with evolving health priorities and consumer behaviors.
Top of Mind, Not Top of Action
Fruits and veggies *should* be a staple. 75% agree they're key to a healthy life. But?
eat what they want, when they want.
The Opportunity: Messaging should focus on helping consumers take the first step - removing friction, offering inspiration and positioning produce as the easiest choice in the moment.
Food Is Medicine: A Growing Preference
60% of Americans would rather change their diet than rely on medication.
The Opportunity: Frame fruits and vegetables as a proactive health strategy in disease prevention. Partner with health-forward influencers and professionals.
Trust the Docs
1 in 4 Americans have been prescribed a health-related diet, and 58% are sticking with it.
The Opportunity: Americans trust doctors more than social media. Build partnerships with clinics and use ""doctor recommended"" messaging.
The GLP-1 Effect
15% of Americans have used GLP-1 drugs (like Ozempic), which often reduce cravings.
The Opportunity: Market produce as satisfying, convenient and ""GLP-1 friendly"" to align with new eating habits.
Smart Social Strategy
Most don't trust social media for nutrition - but YouTube (36%) and Facebook (30%) still lead for those who do.
The Opportunity: Use short, expert-driven content that educates without overselling.
Quick Wins for Produce Marketers
Nudge small, achievable eating shifts.
Elevate ""Food Is Medicine"" messaging.
Collaborate with trusted health voices.
Align packaging with modern appetite changes.
Focus content on high-trust platforms like YouTube & Facebook.

Instructors
Tom Yawman, Founder & CEO, International Produce Training
After retiring from the USDA, Tom founded International Produce Training (IPT) in 2007. Simply by listening, he has established a working knowledge of effective training methods using formal training supplemented by “hands on” training. Inspecting commodities alongside the participants, teaching proper cutting methods when looking for internal defects, sampling techniques to ensure inspection results are accurate for the lot(s) being inspected, and identifying defects and their tolerances, has proved to be very rewarding. This experience has given him the confidence to train individuals on how to inspect produce based on industry-specific standards or specs and/or U.S. Grade Standards.
Paul Manol, Vice President / Lead Instructor, International Produce Training
Paul has over 45 years experience in the agricultural industry, both domestically and internationally, developing and applying inspection, grading, and marketing standards for fruits, vegetables, nuts, grains, pulses, and legumes. Looking back at all of his experiences with the USDA, serving as a Trainer for fruit and vegetable inspection was his real area of passion. It afforded him an opportunity to develop produce inspection training materials utilized by USDA licensed inspectors as well as by the produce industry. Providing inspection and standards training for produce buyers, salespeople, and quality control/assurance inspectors also gave Paul first-hand knowledge of industry needs pertaining to quality assessment of fresh products.

The food safety audit is an essential business activity as it evaluates and verifies that a food establishment, such as a packing facility, operates in a manner that ensures the safety, quality, and integrity of the food products they produce, handle, or sell. Such audits are typically conducted by external auditors, or regulatory agencies. By promoting adherence to food safety standards and best practice, audits contribute to protecting public health and ensuring consumer trust in our food supply.Preparing for a food safety audit is crucial for efficiently getting through the process, whilst confirming your establishment complies with food safety standards and regulations, and ensuring your produce can enter the marketplace. This webinar recording outlines the key steps and approaches to prepare for a successful audit. Including familiarising yourself with the relevant Standards and regulations, getting documentation in order, and conducting internal audits. Highlighting the importance of constantly reviewing all your food safety program documentation, operational procedures, monitoring data, and facilities to ensure audit readiness.

The FSMA Final Rule is aligned with the Produce Traceability Initiative (PTI). All of the Key Data Elements required to be captured, stored and or shared in the Final Rule are incorporated into PTI. The only new Key Data Element is the Traceability Lot Code Source.
The Produce Traceability Initiative created the following resources to assist with the implementation of FSMA 204:

PTI FSMA 204 Electronic Sortable Spreadsheet Templates
The Final Rule requires that ""Firms must provide an electronic sortable spreadsheet containing information FDA requests on CTEs involving particular FTL foods for the date ranges or traceability lot codes specified in our request."" The following spreadsheets are a useful tool to determine specific requirements by role.

Where does FSMA 204 apply?
FSMA 204 applies to all fresh produce items on the Food Traceability List, including imported product from outside the United States. The Final Rule applies to persons (not facilities) who manufacture, process, pack or hold foods that appear on the Food Traceability List or foods that contain a listed food as an ingredient.
Please note that it is expected that the vast majority of buyers will require the Key Data Elements to be shared with them for ALL fresh produce items, not just those items on the FDA Food Traceability List.
The following fresh produce items are included on the Food Traceability List: fresh cucumbers, fresh herbs, fresh leafy greens (including fresh cut leafy greens), fresh melons, fresh peppers, fresh sprouts, fresh tomatoes, fresh tropical tree fruits, all fresh cut fruits, all fresh cut vegetables, ready-to-eat deli salads as well as some seafood, eggs and nut butters.
The traceability lot code assigned at the time of initial packing must be captured, stored and shared through the supply chain from packing all the way to a retail store or foodservice operation/restaurant. As well, the traceability lot code source consisting of the name, address and phone number of the location that the food was packed must be captured, stored and shared through the supply chain from packing to a retail store or food service operation/restaurant.
Does FSMA 204 apply to my company?
A common question is “Does FSMA 204 apply to my company?” There are full and partial exemptions for certain entities. FDA have created a tool to determine if your company is exempt.
The Final Rule requires entities to send an electronic sortable spreadsheet to FDA within 24 hours of the FDA notifying them that they are involved in a traceback investigation. The Produce Traceability Initiative volunteer working groups have created a PTI FSMA 204 implementation Guidance Document to assist industry members in complying with FSMA 204 and creating the electronic sortable spreadsheets to send to FDA. They have created sample spreadsheets for each role in the supply chain.
FSMA 204 is applicable to foods listed on the FTL only. However, the major buyers in the U.S. intend to require the same data set for all produce items received. For items not on the Food Traceability List, the Traceability Lot Code Source could be the corporate office contact information rather than the location where the product was packed.
Your traceability plan must include the following
A description of the procedures you use to maintain the required records, including the format and location of the records.
A description of the procedures you use to identify foods on the FTL that you manufacture, process, pack, or hold and how you assign traceability lot codes to foods on the FTL, if applicable.
A description of how you assign traceability lot codes.
A statement identifying a point of contact for questions regarding your traceability plan and records.
If you grow or raise a food on the FTL (other than eggs), a farm map showing the areas in which you grow or raise such foods, including the location and name of each field (or other growing area) in which you grow a food on the FTL, including geographic coordinates and any other information needed to identify the location of each field or growing area.
How long and where to store records?
You must update your traceability plan as needed to ensure that the information reflects your current practices and to ensure you are compliant with the rule. As well, you must retain your previous traceability plan for two years after you update the plan.
All records required under the rule must be maintained for 2 years from the date they were created and be made available to FDA within 24 hours of a request from FDA via phone, in writing or in person.
Offsite storage of the records is permissible, provided the records can be made available to an FDA representative no later than 24 hours after a request. Electronic records are considered onsite if they are accessible from an onsite location. Electronic records may include electronic links. Records also can be required to be provided in English within a reasonable time if they are maintained in a language other than English. Covered entities may enter into agreements with individuals or firms to create and keep the records required by the rule on their behalf. There is no requirement to create duplicate records or maintain information in a single set.
FDA have created resources to assist companies implement the changes required for compliance

Background - Striving for a Safer Food System
Before the FDA established FSVP as a component of FSMA, companies only needed to have an importer of record. The FDA could inspect a firm’s product at port of entry for pathogens, chemicals, or other documentation to ensure the safety of the product. This was the only way to verify to the safety of the global supply chain of a firm. This process was not as comprehensive as the FSVP that is in place now. On November 16, 2015, FDA published the FSMA final rule on Foreign Supplier Verification Programs (FSVP) for Importers of Food for Humans and Animals and the first compliance dates began May 30, 2017. The final rule requires that importers perform certain risk-based activities to verify that food imported into the United States has been produced in a manner that meets applicable U.S. safety standards. Importers must also verify that the food is not adulterated or that the human food is not misbranded (concerning food allergen labeling). Only the U.S. based importer or U.S. agency, or representative of the foreign owner are responsible for developing and maintaining a FSVP. With over 50% of the U.S. fresh produce being imported, FSVP is a critical program to ensure that food entering is wholesome and safe for consumption by Americans.
This resource summarizes insight gained through interviews with IFPA Food Safety Council Members who have undergone one or more FSVP inspections. Additionally, publicly available data from the FDA website (as of July 2023) has been compiled to identify the most common findings in FSVP inspection.
Ultimately, this information is presented as a case study to identify best practices and provide recommendations on how IFPA member companies can effectively pass FSVP inspections.
What the FDA has Found So Far
These are the top citations found during FSVP-related inspections from 2016 – 2023. Inspectional data was collected from the FDA Compliance Dashboards. Note that FDA reports common inspection findings of all food companies but produce companies' perspectives will be explored.
Develop FSVP“You did not develop an FSVP.”
Developing a FSVP is the first step in ensuring your firm complies with regulations.
Supplier verification - establish written procedures
“You did not establish adequate written procedures for ensuring that appropriate foreign supplier verification activities are conducted with respect to a food you import.”
Having a FSVP in place is important, but it must be maintained and followed as well. This citation essentially states a firm does not have a satisfactory procedure for verifying their suppliers.
Verification activity assurance“You did not determine and document which verification activity or activities were needed to provide adequate assurances that a food you obtain from a foreign supplier is produced in compliance with processes and procedures that provide the required level of public health protection.”
A firm has not verified that their supplier is producing food in a way that is safe. For example, this could be not having a sufficient hazard analysis for each supplier a firm imports from that identifies and has a plan to control all reasonably foreseeable hazards.
Record – translate to English“You did not provide an English translation of an FSVP record that you maintained in a language other than English.”
With companies working with foreign suppliers, it is reasonable that some records are not kept in English. However, the FDA requests that companies provide English translation of all required FSVP documentation for inspections. Companies should try to obtain these translations, if necessary, upon inspection notice.
Recommendations based on IFPA Member Experiences
Read the law carefully and understand the basic requirements you need to follow. (food safety audit, checklist, hazard analysis, certificates).a. Utilize FSVP guidance documents and FDA resources. Completing additional training programs (e.g. developed by FSPCA) may also be beneficial.
Verify all contact information is correct with your firm’s customs broker.
Have your FSVP documentation organized before business is started with a supplier.
Review your paperwork and keep documentation to know who is responsible for certain FSVP activities.
Depending on your firm, it may be beneficial to require your suppliers to undergo third-party GAP certification by a standard that is aligned with FSMA requirements. Alternatively, some standards offer FSMA add-ons.
Establish SOPs that comply with FSVP guidelines. SOPs should be accessible to workers and easy for them to understand.
Keep it simple. Provide required paperwork to FDA but don’t overshare information (can lead to confusion and more digging).
Ask for clarification if FDA instructions are vague.
Be patient and be prepared to walk the inspector though your supply chain process.
Remember that the FDA is not trying to shut you down. Go into the inspection with a good attitude and be willing to work with the inspector.
IFPA Members’ Experiences During FSVP Inspections
Commodities: BerriesSupply Chain Area: Grower/Shipper/DistributorNo. of FSVP Inspections: 1Latest Inspection Date: Summer 2022Communication with FDA throughout inspection: Good. When initially contacted by FDA, the wrong contact person was listed for the firm. This was ultimately corrected with their customs broker. Once mitigated, the member received an initial alert about inspection via email and inspector followed up with firm in timely manner – 2 weeks after documents submitted for review.General Experience: The inspection was done remotely. This member sent the FDA the minimum required documentation for their audit including food safety audit information, FSVP checklist, hazard analyses, and appropriate certificates. Within two weeks, the firm was notified by the FDA that they passed inspection and no corrective action was needed. This member felt prepared for their FSVP inspection and underwent FSVP training through FSPCA, hosted by IFPA (formerly United Fresh Produce Association).Approach to Supplier Verification: The member individually reviews the hazard analysis from farms to verify it complies with FSVP.
Commodities: Avocados and MangoesSupply Chain Area: Grower/DistributorCommunication with FDA throughout inspection: This member felt they had good communication with the FDA during their inspection process and has started building a connection with their inspector.No. of FSVP Inspections: 3Latest Inspection Date: June 2022General Experience: This member has had a generally good experience for there FSVP inspections. With two of the inspections, the member experienced consistency from having the same inspector. After the second inspection, this firm had a better understanding of what to expect. In the third inspection, the member had a different inspector and had a different experience. This member expressed some concerns about the subjectivity of inspections and consistency between inspectors, the industry’s understanding of FSVP, and the inspectors’ knowledge of the produce industry. This member stated that they have had to teach inspectors more about their specific process due to them not being well versed in all types of produce commodities.In the third inspection, the inspector requested documentation from the farm level that the firm was unable to provide. FSVP requires companies to provide verification all the way down to the farm level (i.e., the foreign supplier), but many farms for this firm do not handle the hazard analyses and food safety plans. Instead, this is managed by packhouses. To mitigate this issue, the member recommended its farms to get a FSMA add-on when they have their current GAP audit. In regard to the designation of importer for FSVP, this firm has become more aware of being put down for a supplier as having dealt with being incorrectly listed before. This member completed FSVP training through FSPCA.Approach to Supplier Verification: This firm does an initial audit of packhouses to check if their hazard analysis meets FSVP standards. If it does, the firm will accept and use that for documentation. If not, the firm will work with the packhouse to improve their plan. Chemical hazards are the main dictator for this company on where their product will go and then they follow up with a biological hazard check. Chemical hazards concerns for this company are primarily pesticide residues.
Commodities: Berries, Peas, French Beans, Brussel SproutsSupply Chain Area: Grower/Shipper/PackerNo. of FSVP inspections: 2Latest Inspection Date: February 2023Communication with FDA throughout inspection: The member had good communication with the inspector, however, the firm did need to have their contact information updated by their customs broker.General Experience: In the first inspection, the inspector asked many questions and had a structured way of conducting the audit. The second inspection was done by a different inspector and was more informal. This firm now has a plan in place and utilizes excel to organize its supplier information to make it easier to send. The member noted the inspector for their second inspection was also conducting another inspection that was troublesome, which caused the inspector to be delayed in communication and not ask as many questions. This member also expressed concern with potential inconsistency between different inspectors.This firm had one issue with being designated as the importer for a supplier that they did not do business with. This member has done standardized FSVP training through FSPCA, which they feel has allowed them to better understand the regulation. However, they also noted they believe the way the regulation is written can lead to confusion as produce companies try to adhere.Approach to Supplier Verification: This firm creates a hazard analysis for each product country to identify general hazards associated with that country/commodity. The firm also reviews each supplier’s hazard analysis for specific hazards each supplier needs to control. For this firm, pesticide residue issues are a common concern.
Commodities: Citrus fruit, ApplesSupply Chain Area: Wholesaler/DistributorNo. of FSVP inspections: 1Latest Inspection Date: March 2023General Experience: This firm experienced some challenges during the inspection. The associates who are responsible for FSVP documentation were undergoing FSVP training during the time of inspection. The FDA inspector pulled 3 of their suppliers at random and requested documentation which the firm was unable to provide at the time. The firm received a two-week extension but was still unable to provide documentation. This firm received an additional extension with the issuance of an FDA 483 Form. Additionally, the FDA inspector sent a letter to the firm’s CEO about inspection which detailed the events of inspection, including documents the firm provided and all corrective actions needed to be taken. The firm is still in the process of correcting their FSVP and has been working with their suppliers consistently on these issues. They have encountered problems with translation of documents from their supplier as well as receiving documentation. The inspection was done entirely remote. The firm hasn’t had any problems with being designated as importer for a supplier they don’t do business with. This member has completed FSVP training developed by FSCPA.
Commodities: Berries and TomatoesSupply Chain Area: Grower/ShipperNo. of FSVP inspections: 1Inspection date: Spring 2023Communication with FDA throughout inspection: Generally good throughout the process. This member stated that once they were contacted about an upcoming inspection, they asked what information could be sent ahead of time. They believe this was helpful in making their audit run smoother.General Experience: This member had a good experience with their inspection, originally expecting it to be more difficult. They explained how their firm already had a program in place to supervise the implementation of food safety programs for their suppliers. The firm had to adjust their program slightly to align with FSVP regulations, but it wasn’t too difficult given the firm already had most of the necessary documentation. This member emphasized a crucial component of their success was creating procedures that team members could understand. This member completed standardized FSVP training through FSPCA, hosted by IFPA (formerly United Fresh Produce Association).Approach to Supplier Verification: This firm requires their growers to have a food safety person/team to handle the completion appropriate documentation (e.g., hazard analysis). The most troublesome hazard area for their commodities is the treatment/filtration of the water used for growing.
How Does This Stack up?
Compared to the FDA’s “What to Expect During a Foreign Supplier Verification Programs Inspection” document, members’ experiences have been fairly consistent. Generally, members have had a good experience with inspections considering their interactions and communication with the FDA. This open communication is a crucial component of success during inspections as many times it may be necessary for a firm to further explain their process to an inspector beyond submitting required paperwork. Many members also expressed concern for consistency between inspection due the subjective nature of inspectors. Knowing the requirements of FSVP regulations, having all documentation organized, understanding your firm’s process, and having a helpful attitude toward inspectors can help mitigate these issues. As an additional question, members were asked if their firm has considered participating in the Voluntary Qualified Importer Program. VQIP is a voluntary fee-based program that provides expedited review and import entry of human and animal foods into the United States for participating importers. The consensus among interviewed members is that the program is not viable for their firm, or their firm already participates in a program that is perceived to grant them similar benefits (e.g., CTPAT).
The Takeaway
With the program being relatively new, it can be understandable that some companies are still in the process of improving their FSVP. There has been a learning curve for companies and inspectors alike on discerning how to best handle FSVP. Ultimately, the goal of FSVP is to make certain that food imported into the U.S. is safe for consumers. There has to be open collaboration between industry and government to meet this goal.

At the start of each year, Deon Mahoney from IFPA Australia New Zealand delivers a webinar that takes a dive into consumer and market trends and how they will impact food safety issues in the fresh produce sector.While we enjoy fresh produce for its health and nutrition benefits, there remain issues around produce safety that need to be better managed. Food contamination and foodborne illness continue to affect consumers, and no matter how small the incident, they attract unwanted attention and can negatively impact consumer confidence, market access, and ultimately business profitability.This year’s webinar provides an overview of contemporary food trends identified by various commentators across the food supply chain; followed by a stocktake of incidents affecting fresh produce safety during 2023; and a review of our operating environment describing issues which will potentially shape the safety of fresh produce. The content covers the introduction of the new Primary Production and Processing Standards, the effects of climate change and extreme weather events on contamination, the drive towards improved sustainability and its relationship with food safety, and other emerging food safety issues.

Food labels provide a wide range of information to help consumers make educated food choices. Food labels also help to protect public health and safety by displaying information such as use-by-dates, additives and ingredients, allergens, instructions for safe storage and preparation, and advisory and warning statements.A major challenge for the food industry is understanding the regulatory standards governing the way food is to be labelled. This includes requirements for ingredient lists and percentage labelling, nutrition information panels, food additive labelling, allergen labelling, country of origin labelling, use-by and best-before dates, warning and advisory statements, and restrictions on health claims (nutrition, health and related claims).So, how do food companies in Australia and New Zealand ensure they are complying with all law? It requires a good understanding of the labelling standards as described in Part 1.2 Labelling and other information requirements in the Australia New Zealand Food Standards Code. These standards apply to food businesses in both Australia and New Zealand and set out when a food for sale is required to bear a label or have other information provided with it and describes the information that is to be provided. There is also guidance on the legibility and prominence of information required on labels.
In this webinar, Deon Mahoney provides an overview of food labelling, and its role in protecting public health and in assisting consumers to make informed choices. It will also delve into the ever changing regulatory environment of food labelling, and the importance of getting your labels right.

Food crop production in controlled environments has become an increasingly important sector of both United States and global agriculture. While CEA growers are better able to control some hazards of outdoor production, indoor growers must still manage risks inside their farms in both growing and packing operations.
The CEA Alliance, a trade association of CEA growers and partners, convened a group of members to draft a food safety best practices document for CEA growers of leafy greens, including fresh herbs. Working with IFPA’s food safety team and outside expert consultants and reviewers, the Alliance has just published the new guidance document. Join us in this recorded Virtual Town Hall for this informative session to learn more about food safety efforts in the CEA sector.

If you are uncertain about whether the Food Traceability Rule applies to your business or food, or if you know the rule applies and you’re not sure what do to next, the Getting Started links below will help. You may already be fulfilling some of the rule’s requirements such as Critical Tracking Events (CTEs), maintaining Key Data Elements (KDEs), and a traceability plan.
Do you manufacture, process, pack or hold a food on the Food Traceability List?
Do any exemptions apply to your situation?
What Critical Tracking Events (CTEs) do you conduct?
What Key Data Elements (KDEs) do you already maintain? What additional KDEs do you need to maintain to comply with the final rule?
Develop your traceability plan.
Talk with your supply chain partners.
How can you work together to meet the requirements of the rule? It is helpful to understand your recordkeeping systems and those of your partners in the supply chain so you can determine the best way to communicate traceability information and discuss potential solutions.
The compliance date is January 20, 2026. Start working on this today!
Food Traceability List (FTL)
Section 204 of the FDA Food Safety Modernization Act (FSMA) requires the FDA to designate foods for which additional recordkeeping requirements are appropriate and necessary to protect public health. Additional recordkeeping requirements are outlined in the Food Traceability Final Rule and are intended to allow for faster identification and rapid removal of potentially contaminated food from the market, resulting in fewer foodborne illnesses and/or deaths.
The Food Traceability List (FTL) identifies the foods for which the additional traceability records are required. The additional recordkeeping requirements apply to the foods specifically listed on the FTL, and to foods that contain listed foods as ingredients, provided that the listed food that is used as an ingredient remains in the same form (e.g., fresh) in which it appears on the list.
For additional information about the FTL, view the Food Traceability List
You can find the list of PLU codes for foods on the FSMA 204 Food Traceability List
Key Features
Critical Tracking Events (CTE) (§ 1.1325 through 1.1350) The final rule identifies Critical Tracking Events (CTEs) for which records containing Key Data Elements (KDEs) will be required. The KDEs required will vary depending on the CTE that is being performed.The Critical Tracking Events in the final rule are harvesting; cooling (before initial packing); initial packing of a raw agricultural commodity other than a food obtained from a fishing vessel; first land-based receiving of a food obtained from a fishing vessel; shipping; receiving; and transformation of the food.Below is a brief description of each CTE. For a detailed description of the KDEs that would be required for each CTE, see Critical Tracking Events and Key Data Elements. You can also see how the final rule applies in three different supply chain examples below, including the KDEs and CTEs that would be associated with each commodity.
Harvesting
Harvesting applies to farms and farm mixed-type facilities and means activities that are traditionally performed on farms for the purpose of removing raw agriculture commodities (RACs) from the place they are grown or raised and preparing them for use as food.
Cooling
Cooling means active temperature reduction of a raw agricultural commodity (RAC) using hydrocooling, icing (except icing of seafood), forced air cooling, vacuum cooling, or a similar process.
Initial Packing
Initial Packing means packing a raw agricultural commodity (RAC), other than a food obtained from a fishing vessel, for the first time.
First Land-Based Receiver
First Land-based Receiver is the person taking possession of a food for the first time on land directly from a fishing vessel.
Shipping
Shipping is an event in a food’s supply chain in which a food is arranged for transport (e.g., by truck or ship) from one location to another location. Shipping does not include the sale or shipment of a food directly to a consumer or the donation of surplus food. Shipping does include sending an intracompany shipment of food from one location at a particular street address of a firm to another location at a different street address of the firm.
Receiving
Receiving is an event in a food’s supply chain in which a food is received by someone other than a consumer after being transported (e.g., by truck or ship) from another location. Receiving includes receipt of an intracompany shipment of food from one location at a particular street address of a firm to another location of the firm at a different street address.
Transformation
Transformation is an event in a food’s supply chain that involves manufacturing/processing or changing a food (e.g., by commingling, repacking, or relabeling) or its packaging or packing, when the output is a food on the Food Traceability List (FTL). Transformation does not include the initial packing of a food or activities preceding that event (e.g., harvesting, cooling).
Traceability Lot CodeTraceability lot code (TLC) means a descriptor, often alphanumeric, used to uniquely identify a traceability lot within the records of the firm that assigned the traceability lot code.You must assign a traceability lot code to a food on the Food Traceability List (FTL) when you do any of the following: initially pack a raw agricultural commodity (RAC) other than a food obtained from a fishing vessel; perform the first land-based receiving of a food obtained from a fishing vessel; or transform a food. If you receive an FTL food from an entity that is exempt from the final rule, you must assign a TLC if one has not already been assigned (unless you are a retail food establishment or restaurant). Otherwise, you must not establish a new TLC when you conduct other activities (e.g., shipping) for a food on the Food Traceability List.Once a food has been assigned a TLC, the records required at each Critical Tracking Event (CTE) must include that TLC. All of the Key Data Elements (KDEs), including the TLC, must be linked to the relevant traceability lot.
Traceability Plan (§ 1.1315) If you are subject to the requirements of the final rule, you must establish and maintain a traceability plan containing the following information:
A description of the procedures you use to maintain the records you are required to keep under this rule, including the format and location of these records.
A description of the procedures you use to identify foods on the Food Traceability List that you manufacture, process, pack, or hold;
A description of how you assign traceability lot codes to foods on the Food Traceability List, if applicable;
A statement identifying a point of contact for questions regarding your traceability plan and records; and
If you grow or raise a food on the Food Traceability List (other than eggs), a farm map showing the areas in which you grow or raise such foods.
The farm map must show the location and name of each field (or other growing area) in which you grow a food on the Food Traceability List, including geographic coordinates and any other information needed to identify the location of each field or growing area.
For aquaculture farms, the farm map instead must show the location and name of each container (e.g., pond, pool, tank, cage) in which you raise seafood on the Food Traceability List, including geographic coordinates and any other information needed to identify the location of each container.
Additional Requirements (§ 1.1455)The final rule also requires that:
Records must be maintained as original paper or electronic records, or true copies; they all must be legible and stored to prevent deterioration or loss. Electronic records may include valid, working electronic links to the information required to be maintained under the rule.
All records required under this rule, along with any information required to understand the records, must be made available to the FDA within 24 hours after a request is made (or within a reasonable time to which the FDA has agreed).
Unless exempt from this requirement, an electronic sortable spreadsheet containing relevant traceability information must be provided to the FDA within 24 hours of a request (or within some reasonable time to which the FDA has agreed) when necessary to assist the FDA during an outbreak, recall, or other threat to public health.
Full and Partial Exemptions
The final rule identifies certain exemptions and partial exemptions from the requirements of the final rule. The exemptions are listed in § 1.1305 of the final rule. A tool is available to help stakeholders determine whether an exemption may apply to their situation. Users identify a topic area and then answer a series of yes or no questions.
Exemptions to the Food Traceability Rule
Critical Tracking Events and Key Data Elements
The Food Traceability Rule requires persons who manufacture, process, pack, or hold foods on the Food Traceability List (FTL) to maintain and provide to their supply chain partners with key data elements (KDEs) for certain critical tracking events (CTEs) in the food’s supply chain. This framework forms the foundation for effective and efficient tracing and clearly communicates the information that FDA needs to perform such tracing.
The information that firms must keep and send forward under the rule varies depending on the type of supply chain activities they perform with respect to an FTL food, from harvesting or production of the food through processing, distribution, and receipt at retail or other point of service. Central to the proposed requirements is the assignment, recording, and sharing of traceability lot codes (TLCs) for FTL foods, as well as linking these TLCs to other information identifying the foods as they move through the supply chain.

Supply Chain Examples
The Food Traceability Rule requires persons who manufacture, process, pack, or hold foods on the Food Traceability List (FTL) to maintain and provide to their supply chain partners specific information – called Key Data Elements (KDEs) – for certain Critical Tracking Events (CTEs) in the food’s supply chain. This framework forms the foundation for effective and efficient tracing of food.
The following examples show the Key Data Elements required for the Critical Tracking Events in three example supply chains – fresh cucumbers, tuna steaks, and soft cheese.

The International Fresh Produce Association (IFPA) convened a small group of volunteers from members of the 140+ IFPA Food Safety Council.
Volunteers were tasked with preparation of guidance materials targeted to audiences seeking to comply with the United States of America's Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Produce Safety Rule (PSR) requirements for agricultural water, promulgated as part of the Food Safety Modernization Act (FSMA).
While sections of the rule relating to pre-harvest agricultural water (Subpart E) were under revision by the FDA during the preparation of this guidance document, the resulting briefs and other communications rely on scientific evidence that are applicable to many different cropping systems, recognizing that the rule applies to virtually all produce that is likely to be consumed raw, regardless of where or how it was grown.
The goal was to address the most common points of confusion and to provide additional resources for the produce industry.
As a living document, additions and revisions will continuously occur to improve upon the support materials offered herein. Most importantly, the final provisions within Subpart E of the PSR for pre-harvest agricultural water have not been finalized, so this document is subject to updates pending final regulation release.

Please join Deon Mahoney as he provides an update on the role of food safety programs (FSP) in managing the safety of fresh produce.The fresh produce industry has an obligation to manage the safety of fresh produce in order to both protect public health and maintain consumer confidence. A structured way to manage the safety of fresh produce, meet the requirements of regulatory bodies in Australia and New Zealand, and achieve third party certification to industry standards is for a food business to establish and document a food safety program (FSP).A FSP assists businesses to identify potential hazards to food safety, and to determine how and where along the production chain they can be controlled or managed. Key components of the FSP include documented management commitment to the program; the use of the hazard analysis critical control point (HACCP) system to identify and manage hazards; and the development of pre-requisite programs which support hygienic operating practices and an environment supporting good hygiene. Importantly the FSP ensures a consistent approach to managing food operations, with structured monitoring of key operations and procedures, authenticated corrective action when issues arise, and regular reviews of the performance of the program.By developing and consistently implementing a comprehensive FSP, and undertaking regular management reviews, a food business can be more confident that its food products meet regulations and consumer expectations, as well as demonstrating due diligence.This webinar will examine the key components of a FSP, including the importance of regulatory and industry standards in establishing the program. It will also outline recent changes to the HACCP system and how they may impact your FSP.

The FDA’s FSMA 204 Final Food Traceability Rule is in effect now and will start to be enforced on January 20, 2026. This regulation will require all companies across the supply chain, from growers to retailers and foodservice operators, to track and share data that they have never tracked or shared before.
To assist the industry, 5 Produce Traceability Initiative Working Groups created best practices for the fresh produce supply chain to best comply with the new FSMA 204 requirements.
Hear from the industry chairs that led the working groups as they discuss these best practices and offer insight on how companies can become compliant with the new regulations.

Dry Sanitation

Cleaning vs. Sanitizing – Wet vs. Dry
Before diving into dry sanitation practices, it’s important to understand the big difference between cleaning and sanitizing, an area that people often get confused. Cleaning is the process of physically removing any unwanted soil from an area or surface. Sanitizing is the subsequent process of treating cleaned surfaces to reduce and prevent cross-contamination of pathogenic microorganisms.
Breaking this down further, wet cleaning refers to the method of removing the unwanted soil with water and other products such as mild detergent. It is the most common cleaning method used in the fresh produce industry. Dry cleaning also removes the soil and organic matter, but with tools such as dry brushes or towels.
Wet sanitizing removes the presence of pathogenic microbes traditionally with sanitizing solutions that are water based. Instead, dry sanitizing practices can include non water-based chemical such as alcohol, or other types of dry sanitizing equipment.
Where is Dry Sanitation used?
The purpose of dry sanitation is to utilize cleaning and sanitizing methods that minimize water use as much as possible. Because of nature of the ingredients used and their sensitivity to water, this process is more commonly used within the baking and confectionary industry. Dry sanitation is often employed in areas or situations where the presence of water may pose a risk of equipment damage, electrical hazards, or environmental microbial growth (e.g. Listeria and Salmonella). It is commonly used in food processing facilities for specific equipment or areas.
Within the produce industry, dry sanitation practices are mainly focused on equipment in packinghouses that do not use water in the packing process. It is worth noting that some produce operations may refer to a “dry sanitation” process where water is still used, but in a controlled manner (i.e. manual cleaning with buckets of water and detergent vs. a ‘washdown’ with spraying water). This has led to confusion and differing perspectives on what dry sanitation really is. Additional misconceptions and questions surrounding dry sanitation include efficacy compared to traditional water-based cleaning, odor/hygiene concerns, limited applicability, and regulatory compliance.
Regardless of how the term is being used, what matters most is that therisk of introducing water in a dry (or mostly dry) operation is being properly managed and monitored.
What are some examples of tools and technologies* used for dry sanitation?
Cleaning Tools: Brushes, vacuum cleaners, towels, buckets, non-abrasive scrub pads,
Surface wipes ~35% Water with 65% isopropyl alcohol/quat mixture (for equipment)
Superheated dry steam
Chlorine dioxide gas
UV-C Radiation
Thermal Plasma
*Some technologies being explored for use in dry sanitation are in various stages of development and may yet not be practical for scaled-up used in a packing or handling environment. For operation considering the use of new technologies or new vendors, IFPA has developed an Assessment Tool for Food Safety Product/Service Vendors to facilitate reviews of the products, services, and technologies offered to the produce industry.
When and why might produce industry members implement dry sanitation practices?
The biggest food safety benefit of dry sanitation practices is the management of water in the packing environment, helping prevent the outgrowth of environmental contaminants that may have taken up residence in cracks, crevices, and other hard-to-clean areas. However, dry cleaning and sanitizing are not always appropriate for all sectors of the produce industry.
Some instances when dry sanitation practices could be considered include water scarcity, water-sensitive produce, equipment/ area constraints, and/or implementing dry practices only for specific packing/ processing stages. Water scarcity and water-sensitive produce are very important examples because dry sanitation practices could help conserve water resources and prevent spoilage, degradation, and/or loss of quality of sensitive produce.
Some examples of commodities and packing operations that utilize dry sanitation practices at least some, or all of the time, include avocados, berries, stone fruit, onions, and repack operations.
Regardless of what sanitation method an operation chooses (wet or dry), the knowledge of zoning is very important when categorizing what takes priority in cleaning and sanitizing, and how environmental monitoring should be designed for verification purposes. Sanitary design of equipment and facilities is also very important because it generates a structure of timely cleaning, minimizes the potential for microbial contamination, and inspection of equipment.
What else is needed?
Unfortunately, while some materials exist for the baking and confectionary industries, very few research or resources exist on the topic of dry sanitation in produce operations. Those that exist can be extremely hard to find. Additional resources would be helpful in furthering industry’s knowledge on dry sanitation that are tailored to different produce commodities, as well as sanitation technologies that are used in dry sanitation practices. As these resources are developed it will be important for companies, wholesalers, and distributors to communicate effectively what their definition of dry cleaning/sanitizing is to eliminate any confusion and ensure the applicability of such resources.

FSMA 204 Traceability Rules Think Tank

Sponsored by:
FDA released the Food Safety Modernization Act (FSMA) 204 Final Rule establishing additional recordkeeping requirements for persons who manufacture, process, pack or hold foods FDA has designated for inclusion on the Food Traceability List (FTL). The rule went into effect on January 20, 2023 and will be enforced starting on January 20, 2026. The rule applies to persons who manufacture, process, pack, or hold foods that appear on the Food Traceability List or foods that contain a listed food as an ingredient, unless an exemption applies.
Although the FSMA 204 Final Rule covers more than just fresh produce, similar to the Produce Traceability Initiative (PTI), the produce industry is leading the way on FSMA 204 Final Rule implementation for other industries to follow.
The FSMA 204 Traceability Rules Think Tank explored how the FSMA 204 Final Rule regulations and implementation will be used by buyers, and how IFPA can assist buyers during the implementation period. Additionally, IFPA learned how to best support members from an information and advocacy perspective as IFPA communicates with FDA. It is clear the industry is at different stages of confusion regarding the rule’s expectations and requirements. Some noted there is confusion among suppliers and others between the differences between the FSMA rule and PTI best practices. Many buyers need assistance with identifying compliance expectations for their supplier base, and then identifying how those expectations get conveyed to their distribution network. There is widespread agreement that there needs to be more specifics and clarity communicated on the rule, with IFPA leading the way.
Standardizing rules for all produce commodities
Although the rule technically applies only to foods that appear on the FTL, one of the most important takeaways from the Think Tank was that the industry is determined to implement one set of rules for all produce items, regardless of if the commodities are on the FTL. Simply put, buyers will expect companies to comply with the same set of regulations in the FSMA 204 Final Rule for all commodities. It was noted that companies may experience some pushback from supply chain partners on this expectation, but it was agreed that it is crucial to have the same processes for all commodities in order to improve traceability and avoid confusion between different labeling processes for different commodities. Additionally, distribution centers are not willing or able to manage multiple processes based on different commodities.
Establishing minimum requirements of the rule
The second major takeaway from the discussion was the need to standardize the requirements of the rule across all buyers. Many noted that there has to be absolute minimum requirements established otherwise suppliers will be burdened with too many processes. Additionally, without minimum requirements, retailers will all have different expectations for what data they need to capture and store from their suppliers. The Think Tank participants were very supportive of requiring every company to follow the same set of requirements posed by the rule, similar to the process that was followed for the PTI Harmonized Label. Establishing a minimum set of requirements will help companies’ operations be as efficient as possible in complying with the rule.
Currently, some suppliers use a non PTI Harmonized Case Label and often there is multiple barcodes and even QR codes which can make it confusing for the receiver identify the traceability lot code. There must be a clear way to identify which barcode is the traceability lot code.
Central to the rule’s operation, a traceability lot code is a descriptor, often alphanumeric, used to identify a traceability lot. Traceability lot consists of a batch or lot of food that has been initially packed, received by the first land-based receiver, or transformed. A brand-new data requirement in the FSMA 204 Final Rule is the traceability lot code source. This is the contact information of the location where a food was packed or transformed, and assigned a traceability lot.
Conducting pilots for FDA
Several participants expressed the need to receive increased clarity from FDA on lot traceability expectations. Fortunately, there is widespread interest and willingness among the industry to work with the FDA to conduct traceability pilots. There are natural error rates in shipping product, whether from missing labels, broken labels, or incorrect information on a pallet. Conducting pilots and collecting data will help show FDA realistic expectations for compliance, namely, the accuracy rate that can be reasonably expected with available methods. Otherwise, companies may experience higher costs and less efficient operations by trying to reach an unrealistic lot number accuracy metric for compliance. The hope is that allowing for a margin for error will actually help speed up the identification of the source of the pathogen by removing 100% accuracy assumptions.
PTI’s FSMA workgroup will include pilots, so the industry may be able to demonstrate to FDA the realistic accuracy of tracking lot numbers in stores or restaurants. Instead of needing to provide just one lot number, the hope is that the industry can provide a range of lot numbers from a pick slot at a given time.
Several participants noted the need for a standardized template for a sortable spreadsheet to help with compliance and to get back to the source of an outbreak as quickly as possible, especially with multi-state outbreaks with a lot of locations and data. The spreadsheet will be the best way to record traceability data and will inform any gaps that need to be filled for records. Ultimately, once there is consensus from the industry on a workable spreadsheet, data will be recorded and shared with FDA using this template.
Communicating with supply chain partners
A common concern voiced is the amount of time and work will be required to train sometimes hundreds of suppliers and dozens of distribution centers on the processes to follow to comply with the rule so no loads get rejected. Additionally, buyers noted the challenge the rule will present working with the sometimes inadequate or insufficient data and records of their supply chain partners, namely smaller distribution centers, suppliers, and farmers, who sometimes have outdated technology and methods of keeping data. It will be imperative to make sure all partners understand the rule is not a recommendation or suggestion; it’s a requirement. This was referenced as an issue with the rollout of PTI. However, this must be balanced with the need to be sensitive to suppliers to avoid adding extra work and costs.
It was suggested that retail and foodservice sectors of the supply chain need to work together and communicate with suppliers and distribution centers on the expectations for complying with the rule. One idea presented was that retailers can lead knowledge transfer sessions with suppliers and other partners to ensure all expectations will be met.
It is important to reach alignment from the buying community in order to properly educate the supply chain and work together with partners effectively. Specifically, buyers need to agree to use the harmonized PTI label and standardized electronic Advanced Shipment Notifications (PTI ASNs) and understand what is going to be required of them and their partners in the next three years.
Identifying Next Steps
IFPA is already discussing standardizing expectations of the rule across different industries with FMI. Going forward, it was recommended that at least one member of each company be part of PTI’s FSMA workgroup that meets every three weeks to identify everything included in the rule. The workgroup will communicate out on the expectations of the rule, provide best practices for compliance, and educate the industry more fully on the rule.
To help companies get aligned on expectations of the rule, the Think Tank participants requested IFPA provide a timeline of milestones to help them comply with the rule until it is enforced in 2026. It was recommended that IFPA serve as the point of contact to guide people on meeting certain milestones for 2023, 2024 and 2025.
The participants were interested in meeting again, next time with a few major decision points to make heading into the meeting.

It is recommended that users consult with their own legal and technical advisers to be sure that their own procedures meet applicable requirements.
Objective:
Given that over half of the fresh produce in the U.S. marketplace is imported, understanding the import process is imperative to successfully bringing safe fruits and vegetables into the country, while avoiding delays that may lead to high financial cost and product waste.
This document is intended to provide insight and clarification to common industry questions as it pertains to FDA’s import process for fresh produce.
This document does NOT address import procedures required by U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) or phytosanitary requirements of the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA).
For a high-level overview of the import process for FDA-regulated products, FDA has developed the following short video: Importing FDA-Regulated Products: The Import Process.
Port of Entry vs. Port of Arrival
One key piece of information that impacts the import process is understanding where the process occurs. Your flexibility to transport product during this time can differ based on whether an importer decides that the shipment’s Port of Arrival and the Port of Entry are the same location, or if they are two different locations. In many instances, the Port of Arrival and the Port of Entry are  the same, but they do not have to be (note that there may be different bond requirements for CBP in this case).
The Port of Arrival is the location where the product is first offered for import into the U.S. This may be either the port of unloading (if arriving by water or air) or the port where the product first crosses the border into the U.S (if arriving by land) [21 CFR § 1.276]. It does not have to be the same port where warehouse entry is presented to CBP.
The Port of Entry is any place at which a CBP officer is authorized to accept entries of merchandise to collect duties [19 CFR § 101.1].
FDA inspections and sampling of imported produce occur within the Port of Entry geographic area. A list of Ports of Entry in all 50 states can be found on CBP’s webpage.
What if my product is sampled by FDA at the Port of Entry?
FDA uses a risk-based screening tool “PREDICT” to determine whether a shipment “may proceed” without physical inspection or sampling, or if an inspector needs take action such as visual surveillance and verification, collecting samples for testing, or placing the product under detention (e.g., for products under ‘Detention without physical examination’ listing)
If FDA decides to collect a sample, it will provide the filer, importer, owner and/or consignee, where appropriate, with a Notice of Action/Notice of Sampling. This notice:
advises whether the entry is to be held intact for FDA examination or sampling; and,
specifies the items that need to be held.
More information on FDA import sampling can be found here.
What does this mean for transportation of my product after arriving at the Port of Entry?
FDA does not require product to be held at or near the port of entry prior to an admissibility decision being made (i.e., no ’50-mile’ radius rule). However, if FDA decides to conduct a physical examination or collect a sample of product that has already been moved, FDA can work with CBP to require the product be returned to the Port of Entry. The same holds true if sampled product has been found to be violative.
For this reason, if an importer decides to transport product prior to an import admissibility decision being made, product must remain in the control of that importer!
If product has been further distributed by the importer/consignee prior to receiving an FDA release from import status, this is considered a “Failure to hold” violation.
If the products are not returned to CBP for FDA examination or sample collection, bond action may be taken.
Because of the perishability of fresh produce, if an importer has warehouses, cold storage facilities, or other receiving facilities in a location nearby to a Port of Entry, it may be advantageous to choose that location as the product’s Port of Entry, separate from the Port of Arrival, in the event that a shipment is sampled and/or held for examination by FDA. This way, product may be transported nearer to the ultimate destination (or a location where the importer has available storage), sooner.
What does DWPE mean, how does it relate to an Import Alert, and what is its significance?
Import alerts are issued by FDA when there is a history of violative products (according to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act [FD&C Act]) associated with a specific commodity, shipper/manufacturer, and/or region, or when there is sufficient indication that future import entries may be violative.
An import alert can be issued by shipper/manufacturer, by manufacturer/product combination, or in some circumstances by region/commodity. These listings of import alerts are also known as the Red List.
If a firm, product, and/or region is Red Listed, future imports will be subject to Detention Without Physical Examination (DWPE). DWPE allows the agency to detain all future shipments without physically examining them at the time of entry.
More information on FDA Import Alerts can be found here.
Can I still export product to the U.S. if my firm is listed on an import alert and subject to DWPE?
Individual shipments from parties subject to DWPE may still be imported if the owner, consignee, and/or other responsible party provides evidence which demonstrates that the product doesn’t contain the violation listed in the import alert.
Evidence should be submitted to FDA using the Import Trade Auxiliary Communications System (ITACS).
If importers don’t respond to FDA’s “Notice of Detention and Hearing” or if the evidence provided is not sufficient, their product will be refused entry.
Why might fresh produce commodities or fresh produce importers be added to an import alert?
In fresh produce, the most common reasons for import alerts include illegal pesticide residues or contamination by microbial pathogens.
Various types of processed/dried fruits and vegetables and concentrated juices from certain countries have been issued import alerts due to the presence of heavy metals (i.e., lead, arsenic, cadmium).
This link on the FDA website includes lists of import alerts categorized by product type.
How do I get my firm off of an import alert?
Because import alerts are typically issued in response to a history of violative product, a firm needs to demonstrate to the FDA that the issue has been addressed and corrected, and corrective actions have been applied to prevent future violations.
In other words, firms must “overcome the appearance of violation”.
In many instances, lab results from an established sampling plan are an important component to being Green Listed.
In the future, any product testing being completed to support admission of an imported food must be done by an accredited lab according to the Laboratory Accreditation FSMA Final Rule.
FDA may require a minimum of five (5) consecutive non-violative commercial shipments to confirm the continued effectiveness of any corrective actions before the agency can consider that the appearance of the violation has been overcome, and that it may be appropriate to remove the DWPE.
This applies when product has been declared violative under violative under Section 801(a)(3) of the FD&C Act.
The specific import alert may include more details on requirements before a firm is removed, but FDA has provided some general recommendations on supporting evidence to help with removal, including:
Third-party laboratory analyses
Manufacturing or processing records
FDA establishment inspections
Proof of registration and/or listing
Proof of certification by a foreign government or certified body
Evidence that labeling violations have been corrected
Evidence that the product is in compliance
As another example, IFPA has prepared guidance to help the Mexican papaya industry understand the kinds of information FDA may want to review when preparing a petition for green listing related to Import Alert 21-17.
How will I know, and what should I do if my supplier is listed on an import alert?
FDA updates import alerts nightly and publishes a weekly list of firms that have been put on import alert. Anyone can sign up to receive email notifications.
As a reminder, FDA defines “supplier” for the purpose of compliance with FSVP and Subpart G of the Preventive Controls Rule (the supply chain requirement) as the one that grew or processed/ manufactured the food. It’s important to understand the entities in your supply chain so that you can determine if one of them has been placed on import alert.
If you find that a member of your supply chain is subject to import alert, IFPA recommends that you contact the firm directly to understand the situation and assess if your supply chain is or could be impacted. This should include details around which product/farms were implicated AND what steps are being taken to prevent the issue from recurring.
In general, obtaining negative test results without having assessed the root cause of the problem is not an ideal solution.
Can FDA provide more details related to a firm on an import alert?
The entry process is a commercial matter between the entities identified in the entry transaction (i.e. the importer of record or the consignee), and FDA is prevented from discussing import entries with anyone not identified as a party to the transaction.
If you notice your supplier is included on an Import Alert, you should reach out directly to that supplier for more information.
If your firm is listed on an Import Alert and you would like to address the issue, begin by reaching out directly to the FDA Compliance Officer at the relevant Port of Entry (provided your firm was party on an entry). You may also contact FDA's Division of Import Operations, the component overseeing FDA’s Import Alert system, at FDAImportsInquiry@fda.hhs.gov, to submit an administrative file request. This administrative file will consist of the evidence in FDA's possession leading to the Import Alert addition, including the laboratory analytical results (or other evidence) indicating the presence of the contaminant.
Additional relevant FDA contacts may also be listed on the individual Import Alert.
How can I expedite the entry of imports into the US?
As part of FSMA, FDA developed the Voluntary Qualified Importer Program (VQIP)
VQIP is a voluntary fee-based program offers expedited review and import entry into the U.S. for participating importers. Product imported by a VQIP-approved importer will generally receive a “may proceed” recommendation upon arrival without going to an FDA reviewer for processing.
Examination and/or sampling of VQIP food entries are generally limited to “for cause” situations (i.e., when the food is or may be associated with a risk to the public health) and to audit VQIP.

Beginning Jan 26, 2023, farms began needing to comply with the agriculture water requirements for harvest and post-harvest water contained in Subpart E of the Produce Safety Rule.
While the exact date that FDA will finalize the preharvest agricultural water requirements in Subpart E of the Produce Safety Rule is unknown, the general support of the proposed rule leads IFPA to recommend that the industry begin thinking about how to comply with the rule.
IFPA is developing short resources on a variety of ag water related topics. Download the article, Water Treatment: The Label is the Law which focuses on the legalities of treating agricultural water, which applies to pre-harvest, harvest, and post-harvest water uses.

FDA Draft Guidance for Lead in Baby Foods
Share
Tweet
Email
Share
On January 24, 2023 FDA released draft guidance for Action Levels for Lead in Food Intended for Babies and Young Children. There are a few important details for IFPA member to note from this draft guidance:
This draft guidance defines action levels for processed foods “purported to be specifically for babies and young children less than two years old.”
Fruit and vegetable products, both mixed and single ingredient, are included in the draft action levels, but they do not apply to raw agricultural commodities or homemade foods.
Single-ingredient root vegetable products are singled out as having higher lead levels than other vegetables, based on FDA sampling data from 2008-2021, thus they have their own action level defined.
FDA recommends that baby food manufacturers consider increased testing of ingredients or finished products that are historically known to contain elevated lead levels
FDA will host a webinar to provide an overview of the draft guidance and answer stakeholder questions; IFPA’s food safety team will share details on that webinar as soon as they are available.
As a reminder, although action levels are established through guidance documents (which represent FDA’s current thinking on a topic and do not establish legally enforceable responsibilities), FDA may (and does) use these action levels to define a level of contamination at which a food may be regarded as adulterated according to the FD&C Act.
To learn more about FDA’s draft guidance on Action Levels for Lead in Food Intended for Babies and Young Children and to download the guidance yourself, you can visit FDA’s webpage. You can also read more about FDA’s Closer to Zero Action Plan for Baby Foods here.

The following resource, developed by 2023 IFPA Food Safety Intern Justin Daniel, summarizes insight gained through interviews with IFPA Food Safety Council Members who have undergone one or more FSVP inspections. Additionally, publicly available data from the FDA website has been compiled to identify the most common findings in FSVP inspection. This information is presented as a set of case studies to identify best practices and provide recommendations on how IFPA member companies can effectively pass FSVP inspections.
The following is offered for informational purposes and does not constitute legal advice. Official interpretations of FDA rules can be obtained by submitting an inquiry to FDA’s Technical Assistance Network (TAN). For scientific and technical questions (e.g., related to hazards, test methods, etc.), reach out to the Technical Assistance Network of the Food Safety Preventive Controls Alliance. You can also visit FDA’s FSMA website for official information, and sign up to receive alerts directly from FDA.
If my company is listed as an FSVP importer and believe that it is in error, what should we do to let FDA know?FDA publishes the list of FDA importers quarterly based on customs entry filings. If you believe you have been listed in error, FDA suggests you file a Freedom of Information Act request. Based on our discussions with FDA, we developed a document on how to file a FOIA request that is likely to provide useful information to you (below).
I got a notice from FDA that I need to have a DUNS number, and that UNK will no longer be accepted. What should I do?The final rule requires that the Customs Entry forms indicate the FSVP importer, including their DUNS number. FDA allowed a 5-year transition period for firms to obtain a DUNS number, and allowed the use of ‘UNK’ in the interim. As of July 24, 2022, UNK is no longer being accepted. DUNS numbers are specific to location and you may get a rejection or note from FDA if they see the same DUNS number associated with more than one location. You can request a new DUNS number from Dun & Bradstreet (D&B) through the D&B’s Import Safety Lookup Portal https://www.importregistration.dnb.com. You may also use the Portal to look-up a DUNS number or request an update to a current DUNS number.
If I import produce that isn’t subject to the produce safety rule (e.g. potato, asparagus, and other produce that is rarely consumed raw– see the list here) am I exempt since my foreign supplier (grower) is not subject to the Produce Safety Rule?No. Just because your foreign supplier is exempt from the Produce Safety Rule, it doesn’t mean that you are exempt from FSVP. You still need to conduct a hazard analysis of the food (including chemical hazards such as pesticides, which are not addressed by the PSR), at a minimum, and fulfil the other FSVP requirements based on the hazard analysis.
My supplier is a distributor, aggregator, etc. Who and what am I supposed to verify?“Foreign supplier” is defined as “the establishment that manufactures/processes the food, raises the animal, or grows the food that is exported to the United States without further manufacturing/processing by another establishment, except for further manufacturing/processing that consists solely of the addition of labeling or any similar activity of a de minimis nature” (see p 74341 of the rule). A distributor or aggregator does not meet this definition. As defined in the rule, the foreign supplier is the one growing or producing the food, and may be more than 1 step back in the supply chain. The rule requires you to verify that that entity is controlling the hazards identified in the hazard analysis as needing control.Who is the foreign supplier of a produce RAC, the farm or the packinghouse?“Foreign supplier” is defined as “the establishment that manufactures/processes the food, raises the animal, or grows the food that is exported to the United States without further manufacturing/processing by another establishment, except for further manufacturing/processing that consists solely of the addition of labeling or any similar activity of a de minimis nature” (see p 74341 of the rule). FDA has indicated that since a packinghouse does not do “manufacturing/processing”, the foreign supplier of a RAC would generally be the farm.
If I’m not the importer of record (which is a requirement of Customs and Border Control; not identical to FSVP importer), but I use imported products/ ingredients, do I need to comply with FSVP?Maybe. The FSVP importer may be different from the importer of record. It depends on whether or not you meet the definition of FSVP importer, which is “U.S. owner or consignee of an article of food that is being offered for import into the United States. If there is no U.S. owner or consignee of an article of food at the time of U.S. entry, the importer is the U.S. agent or representative of the foreign owner or consignee at the time of entry, as confirmed in a signed statement of consent to serve as the importer under this subpart.” There are instances where the importer of record may not meet this definition (e.g., by not being US based), however an FSVP importer still needs to be identified.
Should I sign a letter from my customer asking me to take responsibility as the FSVP importer?This depends on whether or not you meet the definition of an FSVP importer. If you do not meet this definition, you cannot be the FSVP importer.
I meet the definition of FSVP importer, but so does my customer (because they have agreed in writing to purchase the imported food from me). They are asking me to sign a statement saying I will bear the responsibilities of the FSVP importer. Is that allowed?It’s true that in some situations, more than one entity may meet the definition of the FSVP importer. In that case, the supply chain needs to determine who, singularly, will be listed as the FSVP importer for that line of food on the Customs entry form, and be responsible for compliance (hazard analysis, supplier evaluation, approval, and verification activities). Signing a statement at your customer’s request is a business decision. Note that FDA requires records be retained for 2 years. If your supplier asks for a longer retention time, agreeing to that is a business decision; FDA will have access to records for as long as you keep them.
My foreign supplier (or broker, or customer) already conducted a hazard analysis for the product. Can I use that?Yes, but you need to have it reviewed by a qualified individual who is able to ascertain if the original analysis is adequate. Also, you need to maintain documentation showing which hazards you are expecting the supplier to control (e.g., the hazard analysis, or comparable document).
The rule says that I don’t need to conduct a hazard analysis when I am importing produce covered by the Produce Safety Rule. Does this mean I don’t need to do anything to comply?No. First, you do need to conduct a hazard analysis for any chemical or physical hazards (e.g., if the food is imported from a region where pesticides are not properly applied, or where there is high pollution, you may identify these hazards as needing controls). Second, the reason that you don’t need to evaluate microbiological hazards is because FDA assumes they are there and need to be controlled (through the implementation of the Produce Safety Rule). Therefore, you will always need to conduct verification of a farm growing covered produce (or ensure someone else in the supply chain is verifying the farm).
What does enforcement look like?FDA is enforcing this rule. Importers are being contacted, often via email, to provide records demonstrating FSVP compliance. There are already several examples of FDA issuing warning letters to importers due to FSVP violations. The most common citation is not having an FSVP! A
FOIA REQUEST
Note to Industry: Addressing Erroneous Inclusion on FDA’s FSVP Importer List
Background
On a roughly quarterly basis, FDA posts the names of entities that have been identified on Customs Entry paperwork as FSVP importers. This list can be downloaded at the bottom of this page: https://www.fda.gov/food/importing-food-products-united-states/foreign-suppliers-verification-programs-list-participants. As of this writing, the list is sorted by state, and then by firm legal name, and the file contains the timeframe for which information is provided.
From time to time, companies have been surprised to see their names listed as FSVP importers. This document lays out the process to request details from FDA in order to understand how a company name/location wound up on the list.
If you don’t think you’re an FSVP importer:
At the web link above, FDA states “If you would like more information regarding entries for which you were declared as the FSVP importer, you can submit a Freedom of Information Act Request to request the publicly releasable data points for those entries for a related timeframe.” This document provides additional details on how to do this, and the information that should be provided by the inquiring firm in order to expedite a response from FDA.
The company who feels they have been listed in error must file a Freedom of Information Act request. If the firm would like a 3rd party (e.g., an attorney) to make the request, the firm listed as the FSVP importer must grant permission to the 3rd party (e.g., on company letterhead) and this must accompany the request by the 3rd party.
The FOIA request should include the dates/ timeframe of interest (e.g., if you’re listed in a report that covers March – May 2020, this would be the timeframe of interest). Bear in mind that implementation of the FSVP rule began May 30 2017; FSVP for importers of fresh produce covered by the Produce Safety rule began July 26, 2018. The broader the timeframe of the FOIA request, the longer it may take FDA to respond.
The spelling of the firm name in the FOIA request should exactly match the spelling on the FDA list (even if there are typos). It’s recommended to also include the correct spelling, as well as any alternate spellings, subsidiaries, DBAs etc.
The FOIA request should also include the DUNS number, and/or location of the alleged FSVP importer. Otherwise, a company with multiple locations may receive data for all locations (and again, the more extensive the request, the more time it will take for the agency to respond).
This information is provided as a service to the industry. It is not legal advice and is subject to change. Contact FDA or an attorney with specific questions.
Expected timeframe for response
FDA has dedicated staff and established processes to handle these FOIA requests. You should expect a response in about one month, depending on the scope of the request.
What to expect from the FOIA response
The inquirer will receive 23 data points associated with the entry(ies) in which the firm was listed as the FSVP importer. This includes the filer, the port of entry, and other information that the firm can use to follow up with those parties to address the improper naming of the FSVP importer.
NOTE
If you determine that you were improperly listed as the FSVP importer, be aware that the published list will not change, because the list reflects the company reported as the FSVP importer at the time of entry. However, your investigation into the error will be helpful so that in the future, the FSVP importer will be entered properly. You should proactively contact the filer and alert them that the declared FSVP importer is not the true FSVP importer and that they should identify the correct FSVP importer moving forward. It’s recommended to keep documentation of your inquiry, and any follow up with the filer, in case you are notified by FDA of an FSVP inspection related to this entry.

Outbreak Questions for Regulators
When a regulator suggests your company might be associated with an outbreak, or you’re not sure why they are asking questions, it’s important that you gather as much information as possible. A subset of the IFPA Food Safety Council developed a list of questions that can help guide a discussion with regulators so that your company has a good grasp on the situation and can respond and react appropriately. The questions are meant to augment, not replace, a company’s regulatory inspection policy.

When thinking about dry sanitation for the food industry, we often think about practices that are related to food facilities producing low moisture foods (e.g., baked goods, nuts). The use of water in fruit and vegetable postharvest handling provides benefits, but also comes with the added cost and logistics of managing postharvest water quality and the greater risk for pathogens. Dry cleaning and sanitation practices remove water from this equation and can be a valuable option for any food producer. Join us for this Virtual Town Hall to learn from other sectors of the food industry, and how current research is shaping how these practices might be adapted to the produce industry.

Maximum residue limits (MRLs) for pesticides, also known as “tolerances” in the United States, are key points of regulation when it comes to both domestic and global produce trade. However, it is also a topic that flies largely under the radar until major regulatory challenges arise, such as discrepancies in tolerance levels among countries, that impact a company’s ability to import or export product. This Virtual Town Hall provides an overview of the regulatory landscape regarding MRLs, identifies current challenges and opportunities for engagement and advocacy, and highlights the direct implication of global MRL policy on produce industry members.

All of us- consumers and the food industry, depend on the US Food and Drug Administration to perform its regulatory role effectively, efficiently, and transparently. Today, ""effective"", ""efficient"", and ""transparent"" are seldom used to describe the FDA, which is the government agency with primary responsibility for produce safety in the US. Given the global nature of the fresh produce supply chain, FDA's impact reaches well outside the bounds of the United States. Although industry bears the ultimate responsibility for producing safe food, the timely development of science and risk-based policies, combined with fair enforcement, is a critical role for regulators.
In this session, hear from representatives of diverse stakeholder groups that have found common ground when it comes to advocating for changes in the organization, governance, and performance of FDA's foods program. Learn about the partnerships IFPA has forged with other food and beverage trade associations, consumer groups, and those representing regulators, all seeking to support public health.

This latest edition of Agriculture Handbook 66 (AH-66) represents a complete revision of the 1986 edition. It has been reorganized and now includes 17 chapters and 138 commodity summaries written by nearly a hundred experts in plant biology and postharvest technology.
This version—like the previous editions of AH-66 in 1954, 1968, 1977, and 1986—presents summaries of current storage requirements of fresh fruits, vegetables, cut flowers, and other horticultural crops.
However, this highly improved and expanded version also includes information on quality characteristics, maturity indices, grading, packaging, precooling, retail display, chilling sensitivity, ethylene production and sensitivity, respiration rates, physiological disorders, postharvest pathology, quarantine issues, and suitability as fresh-cut product.
In addition, a large number of fruits and vegetables were added, as well as sections on food safety, nutritional quality, texture, and fresh-cut produce.

Reasonably Foreseeable Hazard

In both FDA's investigation report related to E. coli O157:H7 and leafy greens, as well as a letter to the Florida Fruit and Vegetable Growers Association related to Cyclospora, FDA stated that the organisms of concern may be ""known or reasonably foreseeable hazards."" This is a term that does appear in the Produce Safety Rule, but is likely more familiar to those with a background in HACCP and who've conducted hazard analyses in accordance with the Preventive Controls Rule.
So what is a ""reasonably foreseeable hazard"" in the context of a growing environment? And what is the implication to others in the supply chain? A subgroup of the United Fresh food safety council was able to have a conversation with FDA on this topic, and the synopsis below reflects our interpretation of the discussion.
The term signals FDA's concern about an issue and indicates an escalation of urgency.
It's not a one-size-fits-all. The exact language of the letter regarding Cyclospora notes that the detection ""may constitute a known or reasonably foreseeable hazard."" In the E. coli report, FDA states that the strain ""appears to be"" a known or reasonably foreseeable hazard. This means that the designation is not absolute, and the assessment should be done on a case-by-case, ranch-by-ranch basis, versus an incrimination of an entire growing region.
This term should prompt growers to re-evaluate potential sources of the hazard, routes of contamination and implementation of controls.
This includes recognizing the importance of adjacent and nearby land use, and adequately assessing risk. This evaluation should consider if the hazard is reasonably likely to occur based on a farm's individual policies, procedures and practices. Growers should move beyond a ""check the box"" approach in conducting this evaluation.
The onus is on the grower to demonstrate the adequacy and effectiveness of controls.
Companies regulated under PCHF purchasing produce from growers where this term has been used should consider how this may impact their hazard analysis. Consider this proclamation a trigger to reevaluate the food safety plan, especially when it comes to supply chain controls.
It's clear that no matter what your role is in the produce supply chain, the term ""reasonably foreseeable hazard"" is here to stay, and it indicates repeated concerns of FDA relative to the produce industry. FDA is increasingly publishing outbreak investigation reports, and we expect this term could be used to continue to encourage heightened attention to hazards, so that their risk can be evaluated and managed.

1906PURE FOOD AND DRUG ACT
Prior to 1906 there was little to no oversight of the food produced and sold to consumers within the United States. This all changed in 1906 with the passage of the Pure Food and Drug Act, the first law in the U.S. to provide regulations to the food industry and protection for consumers against adulterated and misbranded foods.
In the years leading up to 1906, Dr. Harvey Wiley, a chemist at the USDA conducted a series of experiments evaluating the effect of various food preservatives on human volunteers. This group became known as the “Poison Squad”, consuming foods laced with preservatives or additives such as formaldehyde, borax, or sawdust that were commonly found in food at the time. These experiments illustrated the need for oversight and control of the safety of the US food supply.
Simultaneously, in 1904, Upton Sinclair, a young journalist, went undercover in Chicago’s meat packinghouses, experiencing first-hand horrific practices that were unsanitary and unsafe for both the workers and consumers of the products. His fictionalized account of Chicago’s meatpacking industry was first released in a magazine in 1905 and subsequently in 1906 as a book (The Jungle). After catching the attention of President Roosevelt, the packinghouses were further investigated, and the Federal Meat Inspection Act was quickly passed. The passage of this act opened a door for the Pure Food and Drug Act, spearheaded by Dr. Wiley, whose work for years prior had shown the need for such regulations.
Ultimately, the Pure Food and Drug Act prohibited the sale of misbranded or adulterated food and drugs. At its core the act promoted transparency from the industry to the consumer. Initially administrated by the Bureau of Chemistry, the act also paved the way for the establishment of the FDA as we know it today. In 1907, a Board of Food and Drug Inspection was established to help create policy to enforce this new act with Dr. Wiley appointed as the first commissioner. In 1930 the Board of Food and Drug Inspection became The Food and Drug Administration.
1938FOOD, DRUG, ANDCOSMETIC ACT
Establishment of Food Standards
This act replaced the 1906 Pure Food and Drug Act, and while it took years to develop, it gained significant momentum in 1937 after the horrific death of 107 people due to a widely used drug formulated with a highly toxic chemical. In addition to granting FDA the authority to regulate drugs, medical devices, and cosmetics, The Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act established the definition of “adulterated” foods. It also established three standards for food that are still seen today: standard of identity, standard of quality, and a standard regulating the fill of the container.
The first set of standards centered around the use of sodium benzoate as a preservative in tomato products, namely ketchup. Shortly after, standards were established for a host of other products including jams, juices, canned goods, and dairy products.
1993E. COLI O157:H7JACK IN THEBOX OUTBREAK
Between 1992 and 1993, over 700 people across Washington, Idaho, California, and Nevada became infected with E. coli O157:H7, and 4 died after eating undercooked beef patties from a popular fast food chain.
Despite Washington State increasing the required internal temperature of beef patties from the national 140°F to 155°F (the required temperature required to kill E. coli), further investigation of the outbreak revealed that the beef patties did not consistently reach this temperature. E. coli O157:H7 is typically found in the gut of healthy animals, and source investigation determined that during slaughter, the surface of the meat became contaminated and ultimately mixed in with the final ground product.
The aftermath of this crisis became a convoluted blaming web with the Jack in the Box franchises suing the parent company, Jack in the Box blaming its suppliers, and the USDA along with state health officials blaming Jack in the Box for not cooking their hamburgers to 155°F as required by the state. Despite who is to blame, the major lesson learned from this tragic event is the importance of following science-based food safety rules and regulations.
Washington state had raised its required temperature for ground beef from the national 140°F to 155°F in response to a few small E. coli outbreaks in meat products in previous years. The knowledge of how to control the risk was known, and it simply needed to be implemented. This case study also illustrates the impact a single outbreak event can have on the broader industry. As a result of the outbreak, consumer mistrust in the product negatively impacted the meat packaging industry for many years to come.
Impact:
E. coli O157:H7 became a reportable illness in 33 new states (increased from just 12 states).
In 1994, USDA-FSIS declares E. coli O157:H7 to be an adulterant and begins a microbiological testing program to detect Escherichia coli O157:H7 in raw ground beef.
HACCP became required in meat-processing establishments.
While not a direct response, this outbreak was a catalyst for the creation of the Food borne Diseases Active Surveillance Network (FoodNet), housed in the CDC, which works to track and report on food borne outbreaks and trends.
In 1997, President Clinton announced the “Initiative to Ensure the Safety of Imported and Domestic Fruits and Vegetables,” also known as the Fresh Produce Safety Initiative. As the name implies, the goal was to work towards improving the safety of produce, both domestic and imported, consumed within the United States.
The Department of Health and Human Services in collaboration with the Secretary of Agriculture and the wider agricultural community were tasked with issuing guidance on good agricultural practices (GAPs) as well as good manufacturing practices (GMPs) for fruits and vegetables. As a result of this collaboration, the Guide to Minimize Microbial Food Safety Hazards for Fresh Fruits and Vegetables was released.
1998FDA RELEASES GAP GUIDELINES
Impact:
Just over 10 years prior to the ushering in of the Food Safety Modernization Act, much of the information included with this guidance is echoed within the Produce Safety Rule. While this guidance is not legally binding nor a regulatory requirement, it clearly established a precedent that was necessary to later implement into legal standards through the development of FSMA.
2000ESTABLISHMENT OF THE GLOBAL FOOD SAFETY INITIATIVE
The Global Food Safety Initiative (GFSI) is a private organization that maintains a benchmarking scheme for food safety management systems with the goal of creating a common set of requirements for food safety standards .
GFSI was established in 2000 by The Consumer Goods Forum to address food safety incidents that had become increasingly frequent. In addition, GFSI hoped to address ‘audit fatigue’ in which suppliers were required to prepare for multiple, nearly identical food safety audits for different customers. Through its maintenance of a benchmarking system, GFSI aims to support the development of gold-standard 3rd party food safety audits.
Every 5 years, a new guidance document is released on “conforming food safety management standards”. This document is used to compare to and approve auditing bodies with the intention of increasing consistency in food safety practices. Today, GFSI recognized auditing schemes are widely accepted by major buyers of fresh produce.
While a wide variety of menu items at Sheetz were initially associated with the outbreak, the common factor between all implicated products was produce, namely lettuce and tomatoes. Epidemiological traceback initially linked 5 different serotypes of Salmonella enterica to the outbreak; however, later investigation found Salmonella Anatum in an unopened bag of tomatoes, and PFGE matched some of the strains from infected patients to those isolated from the tomatoes.
FDA, along with state health departments, conducted further traceback investigations at the level of the distributor, packers, and growers. Environmental sampling of the packing houses and associated farms did not show a clear source of contamination at the tomato slicing facility.
2004SALMONELLA CONTAMINATED TOMATOES
In 2004, a Salmonella outbreak linked to fresh, sliced Roma tomatoes on deli sandwiches sold at Sheetz convenience stores on the East Coast caused 429 illnesses across 9 states.
Impact:
The outbreak, along with many past unresolved outbreaks of Salmonella Newport ultimately triggered FDA to conduct a longitudinal study on the “Delmarva” peninsula, a major east coast tomato growing region. Using whole genome sequencing (WGS), extensive environmental sampling found consistent positives in streams, creeks, sediment, and geese droppings, indicating certain Salmonella strains as being endemic to the region. This knowledge allowed the implementation of effective controls.
2006E. COLI O157:H7 IN SPINACH
In the summer of 2006, a large E. coli O157:H7 outbreak resulting in over 200 illnesses and 5 deaths across 26 states was traced back to contaminated fresh spinach.
On September 14, the FDA issued a public warning against bagged spinach advising consumers not to eat the product. As the case counts grew, the FDA took drastic actions and on Sept. 16 issued a revised warning against the entire commodity, asking the public to avoid any type of fresh spinach or spinach-containing product. Epidemiological traceback determined the source of the outbreak to be from a single farm in San Benito County, California.
Upon further investigation of the farm and surrounding environment it was noted that the farm was near the San Benito River which cattle and pigs in the area had ready access to. PFGE found that E. coli positive samples of cattle feces and river water matched the outbreak strain. While the farm used well water, not river water, later studies suggested that when ground water levels fall below that of the riverbed, the river water can flow into the groundwater source. Water level and rainfall reports later analyzed provided evidence that this phenomenon was suspected to have occurred in the summer of 2006.
Impact:
The USDA’s Economic Research Service reported a significant drop in spinach sales and, for a period, leafy greens as a whole following the outbreak.
New awareness was brought to the safety of growing, harvesting, and processing of fresh produce, ultimately leading to the establishment of the California and Arizona Leafy Greens Marketing Agreement (LGMA).
Finally, it demonstrated the power of FDA to shut down an industry in the event of an undefined or untraceable outbreak if it is thought to best protect public health.
2008SALMONELLA SAINTPAUL OUTBREAK LINKED TO TOMATOES AND PEPPERS
Salmonella Saintpaul caused 1,300 illnesses (with additional cases in Canada) over 3 months with 252 hospitalizations across 43 states and 2 deaths. While initially linked to raw tomatoes, extensive epidemiological and microbiological testing provided significant evidence against tomatoes as a likely source and revealed that jalapeño and serrano peppers grown in Mexico were in fact the original source of contamination.
On June 7, the FDA issued a nationwide warning against 3 types of tomatoes thought to be implicated in the outbreak. The MN Department of Health determined that it was not tomatoes but rather peppers after illnesses continued to come in weeks after tomatoes were no longer sold in stores and restaurants. They alerted FDA of this trend, suggesting peppers were the real source after conducting a traceback investigation that led them to distributors in California and Texas who purchased product from farms in Mexico.
Finally, on July 17 the tomato warning was lifted after the mounting evidence was obtained. Soon after, on July 21, the FDA isolated the outbreak strain from jalapeño peppers as well as from an irrigation water sample on one of the farms suspected to be a part of the outbreak. In an epidemiological case study conducted following this outbreak, it was noted that cases were significantly associated with eating raw tomatoes, eating at a Mexican-style restaurant, and eating salsa or having raw jalapeño peppers in the household. Items more often used as ingredients in various products- such as peppers- create even more problems as consumers may not be aware of everything they are consuming.
Impact:
Fresh produce is seldom consumed in a vacuum, and more frequently is consumed as an ingredient or in combination with other fresh products. This can pose a challenge in identifying which item the outbreak originated from, and it highlights the necessity of each leg in the outbreak investigation process: epidemiology, traceback, and food and environmental testing data.
Unfortunately, public health decisions must often be made when outbreak data is ambiguous or incomplete. This event illustrates the delicate balancing act that the FDA faces between promoting public health and preventing unnecessary negative impacts on companies and commodity industries as a whole through the issuance of broad public advisories.
2008-2009PEANUT CORPORATION OF AMERICA SALMONELLA OUTBREAK
Throughout 2008 and 2009, 714 people became infected with Salmonella Typhimurium across 46 states following the consumption of contaminated peanut butter or peanut butter containing products. Peanut Corporation of America (PCA) fabricated pathogen testing certificates of analysis and knowingly released contaminated product into commerce.
In 2009, epidemiological tracebacks and investigations conducted by state health departments isolated Salmonella from both opened and unopened 5-pound containers of King Nut brand peanut butter produced by PCA. In a report released by the FDA, multiple instances were cited where product was released into commerce despite PCA’s own internal product tests that resulted in Salmonella positives. An FDA inspection of the facility and processing operation revealed that the facility did not clean the production line after Salmonella Typhimurium was originally found in the paste in September 2008.
While roasting was established as a critical control point and recognized as the kill-step, it was not validated to effectively eliminate the pathogen of concern (Salmonella). Traceback and recalls spanned the course of two years due to the nature of the product and its use in many other foods, and negligence by the company in dealing with the contamination made traceback difficult. PCA supplied its products to hundreds of small, family owned and multibillion-dollar companies who used the peanut products as an ingredient in their foods.
Impact:
This outbreak demonstrated the serious consequences faced by food safety leaders and company executives who falsify records and knowingly ship adulterated food.
Former individuals in PCA top leadership were charged with mail and wire fraud, introduction of adulterated and misbranded food into interstate commerce, conspiracy and obstruction of justice.
In 2014, former owner, Stewart Parnell, and food broker, Michael Parnell, were sentenced to 28 and 20 years in prison. Mary Wilkerson, former quality assurance manager, was sentenced to 5 years.
In 2011, whole cantaloupes from Colorado contaminated with L. monocytogenes caused 147 cases of listeriosis across 28 states, and led to 33 deaths.
Environmental and product sampling yielded positives for L. monocytogenes and PFGE illustrated that these were a match to the outbreak strain collected from patients. FDA investigations pointed to two probable opportunities for cross-contamination: the use of wash water without antimicrobial treatment, and the use of processing equipment formerly used for rarely consumed raw produce without adequate sanitation between use. Reports of an audit conducted in the weeks leading up to the outbreak noted that wash water was a potential problem due to the use of recirculated water without any antimicrobial treatment to eliminate potential pathogen cross-contamination.
Further, FDA investigation and evaluation of the growing and processing environments noted equipment that was difficult to appropriately clean and sanitize, as well as improper draining on the processing floor which led to standing pools of water. The lack of a pre-cooling step prior to cold storage was later understood as a compounding factor, creating an ideal environmental for the proliferation of Listeria.
2011LISTERIA MONOCYTOGENES OUTBREAK IN WHOLE CANTALOUPE
Impact:
Until the 2011 outbreak, Listeria was not recognized as a high risk within the cantaloupe industry. The outbreak additionally highlighted the importance of using appropriate antimicrobial cross-contamination prevention measures and of using packing equipment suitable for the produce being packed, particularly if purchasing the equipment used.
2011FSMA: PRODUCE SAFETY RULE
In 2011 the Food Safety Modernization Act (FSMA) was signed into law, the first major change to food safety policy in the US since the 1938’s Food Drug and Cosmetic Act over 70 years prior. The act ushered in a new wave of food safety policy that employs preventative rather than reactive measures to ensuring the safety of the food supply chain.
The Produce Safety Rule is the first regulation to establish minimum safety standards for the growing, harvesting, packing, and storing of produce and was published in its final form in 2015. Exemptions to the rule include produce that is rarely consumed raw (a list of these products can be found on the FDA’s website) as well as farms with annual sales averaging <$25,000 over the past three years.
The rule is made up of several parts including agricultural water; biological soil amendments; domesticated and wild animals; worker training, health, and hygiene; equipment, tools, and buildings; and the production of sprouts.
The FDA created 7 major rules to assist in FSMA's implementation.
Preventive Controls for Human Food
Preventive Controls for Animal Food
Foreign Supplier Verification programs (FSVP)
The Produce Safety Rule
Accredited Third-Party Certification Program
Sanitary Transport
Intentional Adulteration
2015LISTERIA MONOCYTOGENESIN CARAMEL APPLES
In 2015, contaminated caramel apples led to a multistate listeriosis outbreak resulting in 35 illnesses and 7 deaths.
On January 6, an apple packing facility in central California initiated a recall of Granny Smith and Gala apples after environmental testing showed contamination with Listeria monocytogenes. Three different processors using these apples in their caramel apple products also initiated a recall after being notified that their product could be contaminated. Illness onset ranged from October 17, 2014 to February 12, 2015.
Following the product recall, FDA labs employed PFGE as well as WGS technology and found that the strain from the clinical cases matched those found in product and environmental samples. FDA investigation of the processing operation revealed L. monocytogenes on polishing brushes, drying brushes and inside wooden bins on a packing line. Further research into how Listeria survived on the skin of the apples revealed that the skin, along with the bacteria, was pushed into the flesh when the sticks were inserted as part of caramel apple production.
The caramel coating also may have contributed to the issue by creating a microenvironment between the skin and caramel, which proved to be ideal for the growth of Listeria. While localized to a single California producer and three downstream processors, the impact of the outbreak affected the wider apple industry, taking a toll on marketing and sales.
Impact:
This was the first major outbreak involving apples - prior to this they were considered a relatively safe product since the surface of a whole apple generally lacks the nutrients and water activity optimal for growth. Similar to the 2011 outbreak in cantaloupe, historical lack of a recall or outbreak in a product or commodity does not confer product safety, but rather suggests the need for a critical evaluation of where the risk could lie and what that risk might be for the product. This outbreak also highlighted the importance for the produce industry to consider what the end use of their product will be, whether that be by another manufacturer or at the consumer level.
2018CYCLOSPORA OUTBREAKS IN SALAD AND VEGETABLE TRAYS
In the summer of 2018, two outbreaks of Cyclospora cayetanensis were detected in fresh produce. Beginning in June, FDA reported an outbreak linked to vegetable trays containing broccoli, cauliflower, carrots, and dill dip. A total of 250 cases were confirmed associated with this outbreak. In July, another outbreak was reported across the Midwest.
Epidemiological traceback and FDA analysis confirmed that salad mix used by a large fast food chain, supplied by a fresh-cut processor, was a major source of this outbreak. A total of 511 confirmed cases of Cyclospora infections were associated with consumption of the salad mix. Further traceback investigation by the FDA was unable to pinpoint the original source of contamination for either outbreak.
Impact:
Until 2018, Cyclospora had been considered a risk primarily on fresh produce imported from tropical countries. These outbreaks were the first major indication that Cyclospora may be present in the U.S., either endemic within the population or within the growing environment. An industry-led Blue Ribbon Panel was formed to address these challenges and to identify research needs, as much is still unknown about Cyclospora presence within the U.S. or how producers can prevent or treat the parasite within the production chain.
2018ROMAINE LETTUCE E. COLI O157:H7 OUTBREAKS
In April 2018, an outbreak linked to romaine lettuce resulted in 210 cases of E. coli O157:H7 with 96 hospitalizations and 5 deaths.
Epidemiological and traceback evidence indicated the Yuma, AZ growing region as the likely source of the outbreak. FDA also used whole genome sequencing to link the clinical strain to E. coli found in water samples taken from an irrigation canal in the Yuma growing region.
A large concentrated animal feeding operation (CAFO) was located directly adjacent and uphill from the same irrigation canal, leading many to suspect the CAFO as the ‘smoking gun’ for contamination. However, the exact route of transmission was ultimately undetermined.
Impact
Given the size and scope of the outbreak, an industry-led Leafy Greens Task Force was formed to address the identified risk factors associated with the outbreak. As a result of the task force, certain requirements within the Leafy Greens Marketing Agreement (LGMA) food safety guidelines in California and Arizona were revised, including an increased minimum distance for a field to be located away from nearby CAFOs.
This outbreak similarly highlighted traceability challenges within leafy greens, as well as the inability for foodservice and individual consumers to identify the regional source of their romaine lettuce. While the FDA outbreak advisory informed consumers to discard romaine specifically from the Yuma, AZ growing region, many were required to discard all their romaine due to unknown source region.
In the Fall of 2018, another romaine lettuce outbreak occurred, this time originating from California as the growing season transitioned from California to Arizona.
Although much smaller (62 total illnesses, 25 hospitalizations) than the previous spring romaine outbreak from Yuma, this outbreak gained widespread attention in part due to the announcement occurring immediately before the Thanksgiving holiday, but also due to the widespread scope of the FDA advisory. Again due to traceability challenges, a particular brand or region was unable to be identified.
On November 20, FDA issued a food safety advisory recommending all consumers discard romaine lettuce, regardless of source. On November 26, FDA announced a narrower scope, identifying six CA counties as the likely source of contaminated produce. Following many conversations with government, association, and industry representatives, romaine product was ultimately allowed back on store shelves following a voluntary agreement for industry to label packages with their provenance, or, regional source.
During the FDA’s on-site investigation, samples from sediment within a reservoir on a Santa Barbara county farm was found to contain the outbreak strain. This reservoir water was suggested to be a source of contamination as it was used extensively as agricultural water across the farm; however, traceback indicates that this farm did not supply all of the contaminated product. The specifics of the contamination event are unknown. Potential contact could have been made by direct application to the crop or use of the water on harvesting equipment food contact surfaces.
Impact:
Although not related to the Yuma outbreak strain, WGS did find clinical matches of the fall 2018 outbreak strain to previously unidentified outbreaks in the fall of 2017 and 2016, indicating some manner of seasonality linked to the contamination source.
Similar to the spring outbreak response, an even broader industry Romaine Task Force co-led by United Fresh Produce Association and Produce Marketing Association was developed to further address identified challenges associated with the romaine outbreaks. The task force was made of a broad group of industry leaders, academics, and government and public health representatives and was split into four focus areas: science-based prevention, traceability, provenance labeling, and outbreak investigation improvements. The final report for the task force was published in September 2019.
2019ROMAINE LETTUCE E. COLI O157:H7 OUTBREAK
An FDA investigation determined that one of the outbreak strains was detected in a fecal-soil sampling on public land with grazing cattle. This land was located upslope from the produce farm and suggested to be the source of contamination onto the lettuce. FDA reports of the investigation note that larger cattle operations, located within a closer proximity to the implicated produce field were also sampled and did not contain any strains associated with the outbreak.
In the fall and winter of 2019 we once again see issues arise with the contamination of E. coli O157:H7 on romaine lettuce grown in the Salinas Valley of California. WGS revealed that three unique strains resulted in three separate outbreaks (167, 11, 10 illnesses respectively) occurring over November and December of that year.
Impact:
The frequency of these outbreaks not only highlights the ongoing importance of food safety preventative measures for romaine lettuce, but also that there remain many ‘unknowns’ with regard to specific contamination routes and seasonality. Organizations that fund produce safety research, such as the Center for Produce Safety (CPS) remain as important as ever. In response to the events of this outbreak, the LGMA modified its stance on the treatment of irrigation water in order to mitigate the risk that contaminated well or surface water poses.

In June 2009, the former United Fresh Food Safety Council endorsed a plan to drive harmonization of Good Agricultural Practice (GAP) standards, to reduce audit fatigue and allow operations to focus their food safety resources on achieving food safety, rather than passing audits. This plan evolved into the Produce GAP Harmonization Initiative, an all-industry effort including growers, shippers, produce buyers, government agencies, audit organizations and other stakeholders. During this Virtual Town Hall, panelists from the retail sector, auditing agencies, and extension discuss challenges and success stories as the Produce GAPs Harmonized Standard has evolved to meet industry needs.

Share
In January 2020, the United Fresh Food Safety & Technology Council formed a working group of twelve food safety professionals from across the industry to identify key areas that companies could address to assess the potential of new and novel technologies, services, and products. This group organized and augmented ideas developed during a council exercise. The purpose of this document is to facilitate reviews of the products, services and technologies offered to the produce industry. Providers of such products and services may benefit from understanding the issues that may be raised when initiating conversations with potential users.
The document is divided into the following sections:
General questions
Software
Equipment
Intervention related
Laboratory services
Testing
Summary appendix that provides additional context and considerations
General Questions
How customizable is the software/system/process?
What kind of training is needed? How are training needs supported?
Is this product specific to the US or can it be used/installed/is it permitted in other countries?
How does the system work?
What is the fee, and the fee structure (initial and ongoing fees)?
Are there regulatory agencies that have studied or are in support of this system?
Is regulatory approval needed, and has it been obtained? Is the technology considered an antimicrobial substance or a device and properly registered under applicable requirements?
Does the vendor have any systems in actual production that can be viewed?
Are there OSHA concerns related to the use of this technology?
Is there special equipment or personal protective equipment required for use of this technology?
Does the system require calibration? If so, can calibration be done in house or is it required to be performed by a technician with special equipment? What is the frequency of calibration? Are there any costs associated with calibration activities?
Is customer support available 24/7?
Software
Regarding software the things to consider involve how “off-the-shelf” the platform is. Key questions revolve around what the software really does and how well it works in your environment. Understanding your process workflow, who is capturing what data where, and how it is currently being used are often misunderstood and this can be costly in terms of money and time. Some basic considerations:
Software providers should be challenged to analyze your operation’s specific workflow and how the software will capture it correctly, accounting for who is doing what now, and where and what the output of the data capture will look like.
Will the use of this software require more people taking measurements or capturing data in a different way? Who is responsible for collecting and inputting data?
If you are unable to conform current data capture to the way the software is currently designed, will it require programming changes? Is there a charge for this?
If you need to add/delete information along the way will it require advanced programming and mean data loss? Are the data protected/not changeable?
How often do software upgrades occur? Ask for actual data reports on this.
What does a software upgrade look like? Do all users have to stop using the program/app? Does it require a system reset? What is the potential downtime for this? What are the typical things that go wrong? Is there a cost involved?
If the vendor mentions a number of their current customers- ask them whether the customers have given their approval to use their name. How many of the customers mentioned are still using the software?
What is the support program? Response time? Training? Turn-around time to resolve issues with the software? Customer service support 24/7?
For other data platforms for which you may want to combine data, how easy is it to get a data dump of the raw data?
Will the vendor provide any examples of data linkage or data output between your system and others?
How are data stored (automatically, uploaded to the cloud)?
If everything is pushed to the cloud what happens when access to the cloud is limited, e.g., dead spots or temporary outages?
What specific features (e.g., traceability, documenting corrective actions) are included?
How do the features correspond to audit requirements of different schemes/ regulations? How easy is it to demonstrate compliance?
What languages are available? How can language barriers be overcome?
For software that collects lab data, are you limited to using one lab or can data be transmitted/downloaded from other labs?
What is the interoperability of this system with other software that you, customers, and/or vendors use?
What are the mechanisms for oversight/ review of data?
What training is available for users during launching of software? What level of computer competency is needed by users?
Is there an ability to customize the software for specific applications?
How many users are covered by the initial cost? Are there different levels of access and permissions (e.g., admin, read-only etc.)?
Equipment
It is important to consider all aspects of equipment use, particularly preventive maintenance and sanitation, when considering new vendors. Most questions revolve around how to clean equipment and determining the level support given by vendors. Understanding your facility capabilities and layout is necessary. Here are some basic questions:
Are instructions/guidance available from the original equipment manufacturer regarding appropriate cleaning and sanitizing?
How accessible are all areas to cleaning? How easy is it to fully break down the equipment?
Is there training available on software, cleaning and operation of equipment?
What are the validation studies on the process (wash equipment, modified atmosphere, etc.)?
Does the vendor have certifications (OSHA, ASME, AWS, etc.)?
If part of the equipment, what are the software capabilities?
What is the pack/process/wash line capacity and how are they determined? For wash lines, what is required wash water vs product ratio in wash tanks?
Intervention Related
Intervention related (including antimicrobials) Very few interventions are truly a “kill step” and produce companies should be cautious of claims that sound too good to be true. Efficacy in a laboratory setting rarely translates to the results achieved when the intervention is commercialized.
What concentration/dose is needed? How was that established? What contact time/ parameters are needed?
Was a peer-reviewed validation study conducted?
What are the details of a validation study (matrix, conditions, point/location/time of sampling, starting inoculum, type of organism, etc.)?
Were physical and chemical factors considered as part of any validation and how would they apply to your process?
Temperature: The activity of most disinfectants and sanitizers increases as the temperature increases, but there are some exceptions. Too great of an increase in temperature can cause the disinfectant or sanitizer to degrade or even gas off.
pH: An increase in pH improves the antimicrobial activity of some sanitizers and disinfectants (glutaraldehyde and quaternary ammonium compounds), but decreases the activity of others (phenols, hypochlorites, and iodine).
Water hardness: This reduces the kill rate in certain sanitizers and disinfectants.
What effect does organic or inorganic matter have on the efficacy?
Organic matter can interfere with the antimicrobial’s efficacy by interacting with the active ingredient. It can also reduce the level of activity or protect the microorganisms from attack by acting as a physical barrier.
How is the dose reliably administered, and how can that be monitored?
What is the variation within the data (e.g., by season, location, product type, etc.)?
What is the impact on product quality?
Will there be any impact on equipment or other incompatibilities with your current system?
How/where in the process is the intervention applied?
How can this intervention fit within your current set up/process?
Once the said system is in place, can/will the vendor help with a validated study in your facility/situation?
Has the intervention been applied to a system similar to your process and validated? Are details and/or references available?
Are there any waste disposal issues? Special treatments needed?
Will the application require any changes to the label? Will organic or other status be affected?
Is the antimicrobial technology a substance or device and properly registered under pesticide registration requirements?
Substance: The use of the term substances and mixtures of substances in the definition of pesticide provides the key to separating pesticides from devices. If the product contains a substance that is intended to prevent, destroy, repel, or mitigate a pest then the product is a pesticide and, in general, will require EPA registration. Antimicrobial substances should have an EPA registration with the active ingredient for the product, organisms controlled, and concentrations required for sanitization and disinfection.
Device: If the product consists of an object or article that incorporates a substance or mixture of substances intended to prevent, destroy, repel, or mitigate any pest, the entire product is considered to be a pesticide and is subject to registration under FIFRA section 3. Devices usually generate the antimicrobial onsite. Examples would be ultraviolet light systems, ozone generators, and ultrasonic devices for which claims are made to kill, inactivate, entrap, or suppress the growth of fungi, bacteria, or viruses in various sites.
Laboratory Services
Regarding laboratory services, the most important questions revolve around the laboratory’s capabilities and certifications. Keep in mind your facility and employee needs and abilities when determining which lab to use. Some basic questions are as follows:
What is the sample turnaround time?
How are results communicated? What level of detail accompanies the report?
Who has access to test results? What is the nature of notifications (and escalation, in the event of a positive)?
Has the lab been accredited? By whom, when and for what tests? Can a copy of the auditor’s report be reviewed?
What are the State and Federal certifications needed to perform the required test?
Is there 24/7 customer support? Is there access to a dedicated customer services and support team?
Does the customer have access to software to analyze data?
What is the lab’s industry reputation? Can they provide referrals?
Testing
For most methods, there is a delicate balance between time to result and accuracy. On the surface, the claims usually focus on detection rates and on shorter turn-around times. When it comes to detection understanding how many cells are needed for their method to detect is important. Enrichment time is also often understated or even ignored. While there are PCR methods that give results in minutes, they virtually all need many hours of enrichment. Here are some questions to consider:
Is the test considered “presumptive” or confirmatory? If presumptive, what would be needed to confirm the result?
How many analytes/ organisms are detected at the same time?
On what product matrices was the method validated?
Are there available third-party validations (AOAC, published studies, etc.)
What is the evidence that the test kit functions and performs as advertised?
How fresh was the product used in the validation? This is important because older, temperature-abused product pulled from a grocery outlet has very different microflora than something fresh at harvest.
How many cells are needed for detection? What product volume/ mass is needed?
How did the vendor get the number of cells to the instrument for detection (very important if they talk about very low numbers; were samples concentrated, what was the original sample volume, how long was the enrichment, etc.)
In laboratory trials where there is a claim about the ability to detect, ask how the sample(s) were set up? Did the vendor, for example, apply a known quantity directly to the instrument or sample collection point? How would this compare with collecting actual samples in a processing or production environment?
Is enrichment required? • How long and what are the conditions and preparation needed for the enrichment? Will it resuscitate injured/ damaged cells?
What level of amplification is necessary for the detection technology to work?
Can the test tell if the organism is alive or dead?
What are the false positive and false negative rates? How do they depend on other conditions (e.g., length of enrichment time).
How specific is the test and what are the organisms for which there is cross-reactivity (e.g., a test for E. coli, vs STEC, vs O157:H7).
Does the test yield a viable culture from which additional analyses can be done?
If the fee is based on a price per test- what is the basis for that? Does this assume full capacity of a system (e.g., “batching” of samples)? What if only one sample was run at a time?
Does the vendor provide support with training of personnel?
Is there customer support access 24/7?
If the method it to be performed on-site, what kind of positive controls are needed and how can they be safely managed? What kind of technical expertise, personal protective equipment, and lab facilities are needed?

There is no doubt that food safety is integral to the continued growth of the global fresh produce supply chain. Accordingly, fresh produce operations have a multitude of food safety standards to comply with, both voluntary and federally regulated, all with the aims of protecting public health. But how familiar are you with key international food safety standards such as Codex Alimentarius and the Global Food Safety Initiative (GFSI)? And how might these standards impact your operation, if at all? View the recording of this Virtual Town Hall to learn about the history of these global food safety standards, why they matter, and the importance of produce industry representation in their development and revision from both the producer and buyer perspective.

Improvements in clinical diagnostics have revealed that the parasite Cyclospora cayetanensis sickens approximately 125,000-190,000 Americans each year, with outbreaks generally attributed to fresh produce vehicles.
Once considered a ""tropical"" parasite, Cyclospora has now been detected in several produce items grown in the United States, and FDA has vocally encouraged growers to take risk mitigation measures as appropriate. However, there are no known mitigation measures, and the approaches used by the produce industry to manage other pathogens do not work for Cyclospora.
Additionally, the current inability to grow the organism in the laboratory limits the ability for researchers to provide answers, curbing the availability of commercial test methods. This presents a dilemma for producers when the marketplace, public and regulators seek assurance that the pathogen is being controlled.

Produce safety professionals tap into a reasonable knowledge base to address many foodborne pathogens. However, we are early in our understanding of the parasite Cyclospora cayetanensis. We do know this is a public health issue at its core, but one that has affected the produce industry. Once associated with ""tropical"" environments, recent surveillance work shows that the organism can be found in produce around the world, prompting researchers, governments, and industry to strategize research and mitigation efforts. Join this Virtual Town Hall to gain a basic understanding of what makes Cyclospora different, and learn about the global efforts to understand and control this pathogen.

Root Cause Analysis
Share

Email
Share
Food businesses occasionally encounter situations where product non-conformances have compromised food safety or quality or led to an outbreak of foodborne illness. This may lead to the business needing to dump product or undertake a costly recall or withdrawal.
Root cause analysis is a technique that uncovers the true cause of product contamination or quality problems and supports identification of effective actions to eliminate the problem, prevent recurrence, and reduce risk.
Definitions
Root cause analysis (RCA): an investigative approach used to determine the underlying cause of a system failure
Contributing factor: the specific environmental, biological, procedural, or behavioural factors that result in failure e.g. failure of sanitation, incorrect storage temperature, inadequate supervision
The RCA determines why something has gone wrong; while establishing contributing factors clarifies what actually went wrong.
Performing the RCA
RCA provides a structured proactive approach to incident investigation, allowing more effective long-term solutions that prevent such incidents from recurring.
Describe the incident
Identify what occurred and provide a full description of the incident
Categorise the immediate cause
Establish which systems may have failed resulting in the incident
Determine the root cause
Identify causes and events leading to incident, by brainstorming, using the five whys, or Ishikawa diagrams
Define preventative measures
Identify measures and corrective actions that resolve the failure and minimise the likelihood of recurrence
Various techniques are used to determine how and why a food safety issue has occurred.
The five whys involve repeatedly asking the question WHY? This allows the investigator to scrutinise contributing factors to reveal the underlying root cause of a problem or incident.
While Ishikawa (fishbone) diagrams involve a type of cause-and-effect approach that evaluates factors that may have contributed to an incident (materials, environment, people, equipment and procedures).
Outputs
The analysis will provide information on the underlying cause(s) of an incident and help establish the chain of events leading to its occurrence.
Pitfalls to avoid when undertaking an RCA include:
Focusing on contributing factors rather than on the root causes
Using personnel who lack sufficient investigative skills and knowledge
Failing to ask the right questions
Identifying a single root cause when there may be many
The outputs of an RCA support post-incident review processes, leading to changes to a business's food safety program.
EXAMPLE: Salmonella-contaminated packaged salads cause an outbreak of foodborne illness
Contributing factors: An extreme rainfall event led to increased soil contamination of fresh produce just prior to harvest, and product washing and sanitation was insufficient to control Salmonella contamination
Root causes:
Insufficient scientific knowledge of risk factors (rainfall event) to predict likelihood of Salmonella contamination on incoming raw materials
Inadequate control measures (washing and sanitation) of finished product resulting in Salmonella survival on product
Company culture did not adequately understand product risks and failed to implement appropriate control measures in the food safety program
Investigating food contamination events and issues helps uncover weaknesses in food safety programs and supports enhanced preventative-based controls.

Recall and Crisis Management

Incidents that compromise the safety or integrity of our food supply may have far reaching public health impacts and can devastate an entire sector.
While most food businesses already invest heavily in food safety programs, they also need to plan for the unthinkable. No business is immune to a crisis, so it is wise to be properly prepared.
Impacts of a food safety crisis
A crisis may arise as a result of a major outbreak of foodborne illness, an incident with an undeclared allergen, regulatory action, or intentional tampering. Even a food recall can negatively impact a business.
These events may have a significant economic impact – resulting in a loss of sales, destruction of product, adverse media/social media exposure, temporary or permanent closure, increased scrutiny by regulators, and prosecution and lawsuits.
They may also have long term effects on consumer confidence, create issues with market access, and ultimately challenge the viability of a business.
In 2022, the International Fresh Produce Association (IFPA) recently completed a recall study with the goal of better understanding the business and financial impacts product recalls have on the fresh produce industry. See the result of the survey.
What does crisis management involve?
Crisis management planning starts with the establishment of a crisis management team. The team comprises personnel required to manage the crisis, from senior management to production personnel, as well as communication experts. Often external communication expertise is engaged.
The next task is to identify all possible crisis scenarios, followed by the preparation of responses and procedures to deal with these situations – ensuring the business is prepared to take prompt action to manage sudden and unexpected incidents.
Components of a crisis management plan
The plan establishes roles and responsibilities as well as the circumstances that would trigger the coming together of the crisis management team.
There are various configurations for crisis management plans, but all contain essential elements including: risk assessment, an activation protocol, a chain of command, action plans, and internal and external communication programs. They also address resource requirements, staff training, and a post-incident review process.
The plan can be divided into three phases:
Pre-crisis planning
Crisis response
Post-crisis recovery
Exercises which regularly practice crisis scenarios immerse the team in the realities of a crisis and reinforce an up-to-date crisis management plan. They ensure awareness of potential and evolving threats, guide strategies to diminish their impact, and drive a roadmap for recovery.
Crisis management plan
What could go wrong?
What is the risk to consumers, community, our team, and the brand?
Who needs to be on the crisis team?
What experts need to be involved?
Who needs to be informed – what is the communication plan?
How do we minimise business disruption and resume operations?
Communication plan
Strategic and effective communication can assist a business during a crisis. It requires experience in handling the media, good judgement, and authority. Poor communication can have damaging effects on a business and undermine consumer confidence.
Communication is best handled by partnering with media expertise and responding quickly, honestly, transparently, and co-operatively to manage a crisis. The key is to be up-front, authentic, and accessible.
Summary
The goal of food businesses is that they are not exposed by a crisis or incident that damages their reputation. A comprehensive and action-oriented crisis management plan supports businesses to weather such a storm with decreased consequences.
Failure to plan is both careless and inexcusable.

Managers will learn how to prepare for a recall, the company’s legal responsibilities during a recall, how to determine if a recall is necessary and how to work together to carry one out. And in a table-top exercise based on your company, its products and its production processes, your management team will experience the recall decision making process. Designed for 15-20 people, this option allows your entire team to receive the benefits of our recall ready workshop without having to leave the office.
Annual Maintenance ProgramYour company has already developed a sound recall plan and tested it using our Recall Ready training and simulation option. Now protect your investment and keep your team recall ready with our annual maintenance program. Twelve to eighteen months after the company’s last Recall Ready simulation; we will retest your team and the plan with another simulation. We’ll also review your plan and suggest updates, if necessary. Don’t let time erode your preparedness level – stay recall ready.
Attention All AssociationsInclude the Recall Ready Team in your member training and education program. We will work with you to design a commodity-specific recall ready offering that meets your members’ needs. Call us for more information and pricing.
Onsite Recall Training and SimulationYou don’t want an actual recall to be a training exercise. Get ahead of the game with a two-day mock recall program led by the IFPA Recall Ready team. We’ll come to your office and train your team to use your recall plan under pressure and run a simulated recall to help you test your plan before the real thing.

In this webinar recording, Deon Mahoney (Head of Food Safety IFPA ANZ) hosts a briefing session to provide an overview of the proposal to regulate horticulture products.
In 2018, the Ministerial Forum on Food Regulation requested FSANZ (Food Standards Australia New Zealand) assess food safety risk management for selected horticulture sectors.
FSANZ developed a proposal (P1052) to address the issue in early 2020 and released an initial call for submissions. Subsequently they completed a comprehensive risk assessment, identified risk management options, and published a regulation impact statement.
In this webinar recording, Deon provides a plain English overview of what it all means, and the proposed regulatory and non-regulatory measures.
This recording includes a discussion of the options, and the information gathered during the session is helping to inform the IFPA Australia New Zealand to FSANZ.

Romaine Provenance Labeling

In November 2018 the U.S. FDA and CDC advised consumers to avoid romaine lettuce, since it was not possible for consumers to distinguish the growing regions under investigation and those that were not implicated. As a result, many romaine suppliers agreed to include the growing region, or provenance, on consumer units. This questions-and-answer document, originally drafted by PMA and United Fresh in December 2018 and updated May 2019 by a cross-section of the industry, has been further updated based on learnings from the advisory issued in November 2019.Mission: To provide members of the fresh produce supply chain and consumers easily understandable and accessible information about growing regions associated with romaine products.Vision: This is an interim step until better traceback mechanisms are adopted across the supply chain.
This document addresses recommended provenance labeling for romaine-containing items that are packaged in consumers units, as well as cases that are used to ship romaine (in bulk or in processed forms). The recommendations are summarized in the table below, which is followed by a detailed Q&A that industry members should reference. This guidance is aligned with best practices for case labeling developed by a separate Produce Traceability Initiative workgroup.
The table below summarizes how provenance/region information can be communicated on a case and on a consumer unit. Please read the additional details on this webpage for more information and context.
*PTI labels (Produce Traceability Initiative) is recommended for all produce. See questions 7&9 for more information on labeling cases, including when a PTI label is not applied, or is not used to communicate growing region.
What products are covered by this effort? At this time, romaine lettuce including processed blends containing mature or baby romaine lettuce are covered.
What should be labeled? The growing region should be indicated on consumer-level packages as recommended in this guidance. Cases/boxes containing romaine (only), whether processed or not, and including commodity romaine, should also bear this information on the PTI label (as per the Best Practices for Formatting Case Labels) or through an alternative means.
When should this information be included on packages for consumers? Immediately and until further notice. This is an interim step until better traceback mechanisms are in place.
Does the provenance labeling apply to other leafy greens? Not at this time.
Is this a new regulation from FDA?  No, the indication of growing region for romaine on consumer packages is voluntary but is encouraged by FDA. Although this is a voluntary effort, some retailers and foodservice operators are requiring it. Also, it there are outbreaks in the future associated with romaine, FDA and CDC may advise consumers that they should look for/ask for this information when purchasing or eating romaine to ensure that the available romaine is not from growing regions that could be associated with the outbreak. In addition, they are likely to advise consumers to avoid romaine products that lack growing region information.
For consumer level packages, what terminology should be used (for both field packed and processed romaine)? a. Romaine: (region(s)):i. See Question 12 for recommended regions.ii. See example package at the end of this document (Appendix A) b. For indoor growers, the information in (a) should be preceded by the phrase: Indoor grown
For cases/cartons moving through the supply chain that contain only romaine (processed or not), what terminology should be used? If the shipper/processor uses PTI, then when a case only contains romaine, the PTI label should bear the harvest region(s) of romaine by printing ""Grown in (region(s))"" on the PTI label (note: the item name, in this case romaine, would also be printed as per the standardized PTI label).a. See Question 12 for recommended regionsb. See example PTI label at the end of this document (Appendix B)c. If the shipper/processor does not use PTI, an alternate mechanism (e.g., a sticker) should indicate the region(s) from which romaine was sourced.
What if the consumer unit product contains romaine from multiple growing regions? If product is commingled and contains romaine harvested from multiple regions, then an “and” statement should be included on the consumer unit or the regions should be separated by a comma; e.g. Romaine: (region), (region) or Romaine: (region) and (region). Labeling should be accurate and could include the use of an “and/or” declaration if romaine from multiple growing regions is in the product. However, if an advisory is issued consumers will likely be directed to avoid romaine that could have come from a region subject to the advisory. Therefore, the use of and/or should be as limited as possible.
What if packages or cases contain romaine as well as other ingredients, including other leafy greens? a. For consumer packages: the identification of the romaine ingredient should be indicated as noted in question 4. Growing regions for other ingredients are not recommended.b. For cases: i. Bearing a harmonized PTI label: A separate workgroup organized under the Produce Traceability Initiative established recommendations for including romaine origin on PTI case labels. For cases that contain, for example, salad blends consisting of multiple types of leafy greens or other non-romaine ingredients, do not indicate a growing region on the PTI label (since it would be unclear with ingredient was being referenced). Instead, indicate ""Grown in: multiple/rom"". In the event of an advisory, this information would signal that the item did not contain  romaine, and serve as a cue for the recipient to open the box and check the package to determine the growing region for romaine. Additional information can be found in the Best Practice for Formatting Case Labels available from producetraceability.org. ii. Without a harmonized PTI label: there is flexibility in how to indicate that a) the contents of the case contain romaine and b) the growing region(s). Some producers have retained  terminology consistent with the consumer unit labeling (romaine: region(s)) either on a PTI label or other marking/sticker on the case.
I grow and/or ship bulk romaine for regional processing. Do I have to label anything? While voluntary, yes, it is recommended that growing region be indicated in the human readable space of the PTI label or elsewhere on the case (as discussed in question 7), so that the processor is able to identify growing region(s) on the finished product.
What is the definition of “indoor grown” and how can it be labeled?   It is a controlled environment for growing (not Hoop houses). We recommend that indoor growers follow the label standards and be labeled “Indoor grown” followed by the region, i.e. “Indoor Grown Romaine: (region)”
How should growing regions be named?  A workgroup within the 2019 romaine task force suggests that growing regions be communicated on the label using the designations and abbreviations listed below that are based on the boundaries indicated in the accompanying map. The regions, terminology, and abbreviations were reviewed in the spring of 2020 and no changes were recommended.

*If not listed, use the 2-letter state, province or territory abbreviation unless otherwise noted.**Note: ""Yuma"" includes Bard and Winterhaven, CA.
Does a date need to be included? As long as the date of harvest can be determined using existing dates associated with the product (e.g., the ""Best if used by"" date or Julian date), the date of harvest does not need to be separately included alongside the growing region. Including an additional ""harvest date"" on consumer level packaging could be confusing and is discouraged.
What kinds of media/materials can be used to communicate growing region? The following are recommended:a. For processed products in bags, bowls, etc.: Ink jet or otherwise print information in a way that is legible provides high contrast (see example in Appendix A)b. For unprocessed bagged product (e.g., romaine hearts) that are field packed: stickers/labels can be applied to bagsFor cases used to transport product through the supply chain: GS1-128 PTI label (as noted in Questions 7&9, and illustrated in the exampled in Appendix B), or other sticker/marking that is prominent and legible.
For dual jurisdiction facilities, will this require a label review by USDA FSIS? “FSIS will permit a statement identifying the harvest location and date, consistent with FDA’s advice, on meat or poultry products that contain romaine lettuce. FSIS will also permit statements identifying that a meat or poultry product does not contain romaine lettuce, e.g., adding a sticker to a label that states, ""Does Not Contain Romaine Lettuce."" The addition of these statements to labels does not require submitting the labels to FSIS for sketch or temporary approval. Both types of statements are not considered special claims and are generically approved under Title 9 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Part 412.2.”
What fonts and print sizes, color can be used? The information should be prominent, conspicuous and easy to read.a. For consumer packages: While color is not specified, information is most easily read when there is visual contrast (e.g., contrast the contents or packaging graphics), upper and lower-case letters (not all upper case), and a font size no smaller than 8-point font. Different font styles are more legible than others, especially at the smaller font size. For example, OCRB is a font style that some industry members prefer.b. For case labeling: Follow the best practices for formatting case labels with a PTI label or other comparable marking that is easy to identify and read.
Where should the information conveying region appear on the package or box?a. For consumer packages: The information should be prominently displayed on the front (principle display panel) of a consumer package. It is recommended that this information be located close to the use by/best by date. Be aware of proper customer readability with adequate visual contract between the ink color relative to contents or packaging graphics. If stickers are used on packages that have a perforated tear off, the sticker should be applied to the part of the packaging below the tear off, so that the information is not discarded.b. For consumer packages, information on growing regions should not appear close to the legally-required corporate address for the distributor/brand. This practice was reported as the main source of confusion during the 2019 advisory.c. For case labeling: Follow the best practices for case labeling if using a PTI label, as explained.
Under what circumstances is an in-store point of sale sign needed for bulk, unpackaged romaine, and what should it say? Because retail and foodservice establishments promptly act on advisories, product under advisory should not be available for sale. Therefore, information on growing region does not need to be displayed by retailers on an ongoing basis. When there is an advisory, retailers should have a sign indicating that bulk, unpackaged romaine for sale is from an area not subject to the advisory.
If products are transformed in-store and don’t bear a label what is suggested? CDC advised that “restaurants and retailers should check the label on bags or boxes of romaine lettuce, or ask their suppliers about the source of their romaine lettuce.” This is facilitated by including harvest region as part of the PTI or other case label, as noted above. Retailers transforming product in-store (e.g., prepared foods) should ensure that the romaine is not product under an advisory, and should be prepared to address consumer questions.
Will restaurants need to provide growing region information to consumers?  Foodservice operations may field consumer questions as well as adhere to potential removal advisories. Foodservice products should include regional information on the end unit or box.
What if I ship to Canada?  CFIA is not requiring any unique information for romaine at this time. If you have any questions, please contact the CFIA National Import Service Centre (NISC) from 7:00 a.m. to 3:00 a.m. (Eastern Time) at 1-800-835-4486 (Canada or USA).
Must all points in the supply chain capture growing region information as part of their traceability information?  The label/sticker information is in addition to traceability information that should be captured electronically. The Key Data Elements (e.g., the information encoded in the PTI bar code) of a robust traceability system would provide more detailed information that what is provided through this initiative
Should the growing region be printed on the Bill of Lading? This is not practical for many companies, and is not truly traceability information. In the event of a traceback situation, this information could be useful in more quickly identifying and excluding shipments and regions that may or may not be involved in an outbreak or an advisory. However, this should not be in lieu of more granular traceability information.
Appendix A.Example label on a bagged salad (in the upper right corner of the package; font size for the romaine declaration is font size 8, using the OCRB font style):Appendix B.
Example 1. Harmonized PTI label (this example is only applicable to products containing only romaine, not blends).
Example 2. Alternative format of human readable information, while maintaining the format of the PTI barcode.

Produce Safety Rule
The FDA published the final rule on Standards for the Growing, Harvesting, Packing, and Holding of Produce for Human Consumption, commonly called the Produce Rule, on Nov. 10, 2015. The rule applies to fruits and vegetables for human consumption that are raw agricultural commodities, and sets standards for the growing, harvesting, packing and holding of such produce to minimize the risk of serious adverse health consequences or death.
This regulation affects both international and domestic produce growers, in that it establishes science-based standards focused on the growing, harvesting, packing and holding of produce on farms.
The key provision areas include agricultural water quality standards and testing, standards for using raw manure and compost, training, control of domestic and wild animals, equipment, tools, buildings, sanitation as well as worker health and hygiene.
This on-farm produce safety regulation is significant in that FDA has placed an enforceable implementing regulation which explicitly articulates on-farm standards of conduct for the safe growing, harvesting, packing and holding of fresh produce.
Although compliance dates for major portions of the Produce Safety Rule have already passed, certain provisions and definitions remain unresolved. Check back for more information and updates on topics such as agricultural water and ‘farm vs. facility’ definitions.

FDA Proposed Agricultural Water Rule
In 2019, FDA announced the finalization of compliance date extensions for the agricultural water portion of the Produce Safety Rule in order to allow time for FDA to reconsider and rewrite the rule. In anticipation of publication of the proposed agricultural water rule a list of common questions often asked in relation to the industry’s use, monitoring, and management of agricultural water was developed. Download the resource below for detailed answers and associated references to these frequently asked questions.

Fixing FSMA’s Ag Water Requirements
Read an article on Agricultural Water written by Jennifer McEntire, Ph.D. International Fresh Produce Association, and Jim Gorny, Ph.D., formerly PMA, in Food Safety Magazine’s August/September 2017 edition
UVM Water Testing Labs
Although the FDA’s current ag water rule is being rewritten, grower’s may still wish to test their water to better understand their water source quality or for audit and buyer requirements. The University of Vermont created a map of US Water Testing Laboratories. That map can be found on the UVM website here.

This PowerPoint includes a few slides that review the latest FDA announcements regarding the provisions in Subpart E that relate to agricultural water.
Farm vs. Facility
The line for packinghouses and cooling operations is still blurry. Read this co-authored article by Dr. Jennifer McEntire and  Dr. Jim Gorny (formerly with PMA), talking about our proposed solution.
Do farms need to register with FDA? What about their packinghouses? What if they are exporting to the U.S.- don’t they need a registration number?
No, no and no. Farms, including packinghouses that meet the definition of secondary activities farms, are not required to register and should not register with FDA, whether located inside or outside of the U.S. Facilities that manufacture, process, pack and/or hold food (that don’t meet the farm definition) are required to register. FDA has a very comprehensive Q&A on facility registration.
Produce Safety Network
FDA’s Produce Safety Network (PSN) was established to support the efforts of farmers, regulators, and other key stakeholders to implement the rule. The network consists of FDA produce safety experts, located in various locations throughout the country.

Sampling and testing fresh produce, whether pre-harvest, as a raw material/ingredient, or as a finished product, should only be done with a full understanding of the statistical and practical limitations of testing, clarity around what a sample is being tested for, the purpose of testing, and the response to unacceptable results.
The 2010 Microbiological testing of produce paper discusses pros and cons of testing in different situations. The 2020 “key questions” document is a guide food safety professionals can use as a reminder of the numerous factors that should be considered when developing a sampling and testing program to detect pathogens in finished product. This includes the “how-tos” of a testing program, as well as how to interpret, act upon, and communicate a positive finding. Further, consideration should be given to managing supplier and customer expectations, including situations in which they are also testing product.

Because pre-harvest testing has unique complexities, specific resources are available. In addition to clarifying some misconceptions, there are several resources related to outbreak information provided by FDA which was used to reverse engineer a pre-harvest sampling plan that, with assumptions, could have detected the high level of contamination that presumably caused the outbreak. Visual illustrations and the background calculations are provided to support the explanation of this thought experiment.

Is it really a big deal? Why?YES. Because FDA (and other regulators) are using it to link pathogen isolates from your food or your facility to human illness.
Didn’t they have systems to do this before? How is this new?It is a newer technology that is far superior to the previous approach (pulsed field gel electrophoresis; PFGE). In a 2015 article in Scientific American, David Acheson, a former official at both the USDA and the FDA, likened the difference to a witness in a hit and run accident. “While PFGE might identify the vehicle as a brown Toyota Corolla, whole genome sequencing provides the license number and even the vehicle identification number.”
Is this related to the “swab-athons” I’ve heard about, where FDA or states take hundreds of environmental samples?Yes. Any time they find L. monocytogenes, they are sequencing the isolate and entering it into the database to see if there is a match to illness—even if that illness occurred years ago.
Additional informationWhole genome sequencing (WGS) technology has rapidly evolved in recent years. It is now possible to rapidly and inexpensively sequence bacteria, such as foodborne pathogens, to obtain a “fingerprint”. WGS has been adopted by FDA, USDA and CDC and has been used in microbial foodborne illness investigations for the last several years. Government agencies use a database called GenomeTrakr, which now has over 60,000 bacterial isolates from food and clinical sources. It is vital that the food industry understand the emerging technology and its application.
Food Safety News reported that by using WGS, FDA was able to show that a specific strain of L. monocytogenes in an ice cream production facility was resident (not transient). The company received a warning letter which stated, “The evidence demonstrates that L. monocytogenes has maintained its presence within your production facility since 2015. The reoccurring presence of an identical strain of L. monocytogenes in your environment indicates a resident strain or niche harborage site present in the facility… These findings also demonstrate that your sanitation procedures have historically been inadequate to control, reduce, or eliminate this pathogenic organism from your facility.”
Just because FDA (or USDA FSIS) finds a match between your product or facility and human illness, does it prove that you are at fault? While the single piece of evidence may not be conclusive, you can certainly expect the regulators to come asking questions. A poster presented at the United Fresh Produce Convention in June 2016 described a 2-year study of L. monocytogenes found in multiple packing houses. The researchers, out of Dr. Trevor Suslow’s lab at UC Davis, used different molecular techniques including Whole Genome Sequencing and Pulse Field Gel Electrophoresis (PFGE) to sort and characterize the isolates. They found that “Indistinguishable and closely related pulsotypes were observed in the same packing facility on multiple sample collection dates suggesting persistence or residency of a given strain. Furthermore, some L. monocytogenes isolates recovered from different facilities (geographically far apart), in different years were found to have indistinguishable or highly related PFGE pulsotypes.”
More science is needed to understand how quickly different organisms evolve, and the geographic distribution and persistence of “indistinguishable” pathogens. Although there is still a lot to learn about what WGS can and can’t tell us, regulators are nevertheless using this technology and the impact on the fresh produce industry will continue to increase.

Listeria Overview for General Understanding
Listeria monocytogenes remains a food pathogen of priority due to both the severity of listeriosis in humans and the frequency of outbreaks caused by Lm contamination.
Understanding and implementing effective preventive control strategies to reduce, control and/or eliminate the risk of listeriosis in produce grown, packed, manufactured/processed or held is critical.
What is Listeria monocytogenes (Lm, or L. mono)?
Lm are bacteria that cause the foodborne illness Listeriosis.
People can get sick from Lm if they eat a food that is contaminated with Lm.
Foods that have been associated with Lm are raw milk, inadequately pasteurized milk, chocolate milk, cheeses (particularly soft cheeses), ice cream, raw fruits and vegetables, raw poultry and meats (all types), fermented raw-meat sausages, hot dogs and deli meats, and raw and smoked fish and other seafood.
Compared to other foodborne illnesses, such as Salmonella or E. coli, the number of people infected with Listeria is small. However, this bacterium is one of the leading causes of death from foodborne illness.
Who is most at risk?
Pregnant women are more susceptible to Listeria infection. While many pregnant women recover from the illness, their babies do not.
People with weakened immune systems are also more susceptible, such as AIDS and cancer patients.
The elderly are also especially vulnerable.
Why is Listeria monocytogenes a concern to growers, packers and fresh-cut processors?
Listeria can be found in the same environments where fresh fruits and vegetables are grown. It can be found in soil, water and decaying vegetation. It can also establish itself in cold, wet environments, which are common conditions in packing facilities.
Listeria could possibly be transferred from raw fruits and vegetables from the field and introduced into packing facilities. This transient Listeria could become established in the facility if proper sanitation practices are not carried out. These bacteria that find a home in niches in the facility are often referred to as resident.
This resident Listeria could multiply if conditions are favorable in the facility and then contaminate the produce by moving from facility contact surfaces onto fruits and vegetables.
This cross contamination can be prevented if proper cleaning and sanitation and environmental monitoring programs are established.

Traceability is a business process that enables trading partners to follow products forward and backward through the supply chain.
Produce Traceability
Traceability is important to the produce industry for many reasons, including improving food safety by being able to quickly and accurately remove potentially harmful products from the supply chain. The Produce Traceability Initiative (PTI) is an industry led initiative to achieve whole chain traceability in the produce supply chain by using common industry data standards and the electronic storage and retrieval of traceability related data.
Traceability has become an issue of great importance to the produce industry due to regulatory requirements such as the U.S. Bioterrorism Act, as well as ongoing food safety issues and the need for supply chain transparency and more information on the produce we grow, pack, ship, store, process, distribute and sell.
The Produce Traceability Initiative was formed in 2008 by representatives from over 40 companies including growers, packer/shippers, marketers, distributors and wholesalers, food service and retail and eight trade associations to begin working on an action plan to ensure the industry has a process that will work for the entire supply chain.
The Produce Traceability Initiative Steering Committee developed a traceability solution that members felt could be reasonably implemented by produce companies, large and small alike, across the entire supply chain and operating within the U.S. market and those exporting to the U.S.
Leafy Green Traceability Pilots Reveal the Value of Sharing Extended Product Information During a Traceback Investigation
On December 3, 2020 a group of six industry organizations released a report outlining four months of leafy green traceability pilots with supply chain partners, including growers, distributors and both independent and chain retailers, offering a detailed response to the request by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (U.S. FDA) for improved traceability in the food system.
The three pilots, conducted July through October, showed that investigations into foodborne illness outbreaks could be streamlined and conducted more effectively when supply chain partners provided extended product information during tracebacks.
Additionally, the use of a standard template called the Produce Traceback Template to exchange pertinent product information was found to enhance the speed of tracing procedures. All of the pilots were successful in tracing the source of the affected product.
Food Traceability in Legislative and Regulatory Circles
While several congressional bills include traceability either as a component or as the exclusive focus including the Food Safety Modernization Act (FSMA), which will encompass a record-keeping rule that focuses on traceability.
Industry Perspective on Proposed Rule
Growers, fresh-cut processors, distributors, and retail/foodservice sectors each face unique challenges in capturing, managing and linking traceability data, and developed a white paper to share some of these perspectives.
FDA's Product Tracing Pilot Report Released from IFT aligns with PTI
A report, Pilot Projects for Improving Product Tracing Along the Food Supply System Final Report, required by FSMA was published for the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) by the Institute of Food Technologists (IFT). It provided recommendations on traceability that are consistent with the industry's Produce Traceability Initiative. The report aligns with PTI in many of its recommendations, including:
encouraging current industry-led initiatives
not excluding commodities
accepting electronic traceability data/records during product tracing investigations
requiring all organizations that handle food in the supply chain to identify and maintain records of traceability related information
Produce Traceability Initiative Participating Companies
PTI is supported by the volunteer work of dozens of companies that hail from across the fresh produce supply chain, from farm to store to table. Representatives of these companies currently serve as volunteers to PTI's Leadership Council, Executive Committee, working groups and/or task forces.
Global Food Traceability Center (GFTC)
The Global Food Traceability Center (GFTC) is a collaborative partnership including public and private stakeholders, created to address the challenges and opportunities of global food traceability implementation.
The Mission of the GFTC is to serve all aspects of the global food system by generating knowledge that addresses informational gaps while delivering applied research, objective advice, and practical expertise about food product traceability and data collaboration for private benefit and public good.
PMA participates as the sole produce trade association as a founding member and advisory board member of the GFTC. This will ensure the fundamentals of the Produce Traceability Initiative will be adopted by the GFTC as the global standard for fresh produce traceability.

I'm your host, Vonnie Estes, vice president of technology for the Produce Marketing Association. And I've spent years in the ag-tech sector. So I can attest, it's hard to navigate this ever-changing world in developing and adopting new solutions to industry problems. Thanks for joining us and for allowing us to serve as your guide to the new world of produce and technology. My goal of the podcast is to outline a problem in the produce industry and then discuss several possible solutions that can be deployed today.

Vonnie Estes, PMA:Today, we will hear a recording of a fireside chat I had with Nate Storey, the chief science officer of Plenty at the 16th Annual Canadian Summit on Food Safety 2021. At the end of the conversation, you will hear a Q and A that I think you will find interesting and was worth leaving in. We will talk about food safety at Plenty and in the CEA space. When indoor ag was first getting going years ago, many companies, not saying Plenty was one of them, positioned indoor ag is us versus them, them being outdoor growers. And that indoor was better on many dimensions, food safety being one of the big ones. Plenty and most of the other indoor companies talk now about growing the pie, that producing more fruits and vegetables in different ways is better for everyone, indoor and out. Nate talks about the problems both sectors face in transparency, technology adoption, and labor. Let's jump into this very candid discussion about food safety and technology.
Nate Storey, Plenty:My name is Nate Storey, and I'm one of the co-founders at Plenty. Plenty is an indoor farming company. So we grow food indoors under artificial light. These are in big warehouses basically. And we're able to condense a lot of production into a very small amount of space. So we got started because we felt like we needed to grow the world's capacity to grow fresh fruits and vegetables. In the United States, we're incredibly blessed. We have a lot of farm land. We have a lot of agricultural capacity. Other parts of the world, not quite as fortunate. And as we start to think about a global population that's much larger than it is today, the need for fresh fruits and vegetables is only going to grow, but the capacity that we have today, running full bore 100%, for the next decades won't be able to keep up with that demand.
Nate Storey, Plenty:So that's why we started Plenty. To meet that demand with this new source of supply. Yeah, so our farms are very large. We're growing on these vertical planes. It looks like you took a field and you stood it on its edge and put another field back-to-back with it. And these are very big, very complex farms, but they're pretty awesome. They allow us to control everything. The environment's completely controlled. Our day length is controlled, nutrients. We're able to exclude pests. We're able to collect a lot of data in keeping with the theme of these conversations. And we're able to understand a lot about plant growth in our systems and produce a product that's really pretty great day in and day out. So we produce that product and we sell it and people get the same thing every single day when they buy a Plenty product.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:What are you growing? Let people what crops are you growing now and what crops are you planning on growing in the next couple of years.
Nate Storey, Plenty:Yeah. So right now we're mostly focused on leafy greens. Most folks in the space start with leafy greens because they feel like an easy crop to grow. You're focusing on that primary production, but we have been working very hard on strawberries. We've got a partnership with Driscoll's developing strawberries for indoor production. We've been working very hard on tomatoes. We've got a few other crops like raspberries and a few other things in the works. So I anticipate we're going to be taking a lot of new crops to the world over the next few years.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:And how many farms do you have now?
Nate Storey, Plenty:So right now we have three farming sites. So we have basically our R&D farm. This is our advanced research facility in Laramie, Wyoming. And there we have around 50 discrete environments that we use for plant research. These are relatively small production spaces, but other people call them farms. I think we'll just call the whole complex a farm site. You've got the South San Francisco farm, which is our pilot and we're growing there in South San Francisco and distributing to a number of sources throughout the Bay Area. And we're in currently in the process of building the Compton farm, which is the first instance of this very, very large farm. It's also probably the smallest farm we'll ever built.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:Oh, interesting. And when are you projecting that will be completed in Compton?
Nate Storey, Plenty:We'll be finishing that up towards the end of this year and bringing it online. Yeah.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:Great. So this conference is about food safety. How do you think about food safety at Plenty?
Nate Storey, Plenty:Yeah. Food safety is something that we spend a lot of time and money and attention on. I think it's become one of these things which is one of these top concerns for consumers. And when they buy product, it used to be the assumption is this is a safe product. I think that that's still generally true, but there's been a lot of food safety recalls. There's been a lot of things in the news lately that I think have people questioning safety. And so at Plenty, we recognize that that's one of the most important things that we can be focused on. I will say, we've got a fundamentally different kind of problem compared to folks who are growing in uncontrolled environment.
Nate Storey, Plenty:So you look at a lot of the food safety recalls of the last few years, and a lot of them had nothing to do with best practices in some instances, right? Or they're totally uncontrolled things, right? You've got a wild boar that walks through a field and poops, right? How do you control for that? So at Plenty we have a very different scenario, that a wild boar can't walk through our farm, right? Because it is inside of a building. It's locked. People are using key cards to get in and out of the farm. They're gowned up from head to toe. We're able to practice really excellent exclusion practices. So keeping pests and pathogens out altogether. So I guess all of that to say, it's a very different problem that we have to solve compared to someone who is still trying to grow in the field and trying to keep wild boars out, right?
Nate Storey, Plenty:So all of that to say, we think a lot about prevention and risk management, sanitization, exclusion, cleanliness, all of the components that keep our produce very, very clean. Human hands don't touch this stuff because we've automated many of our processes in an effort to eliminate all of the potential points of contamination in the growing and processing process. We practice really good traceability so that if something ever does go wrong we know where and how. And then we've got testing and analysis that's quite aggressive. And I guess the thing that I'd say there is testing is getting a lot better. But testing and traceability go hand in hand because you don't want to be using traceability to try and find the source of a problem that's exposed by food your consumers are eating.
Nate Storey, Plenty:You want to be testing really aggressively hand in hand with traceability so that you can catch anything before it ever occurs. And I guess the last thing I'd add is, again, in keeping with this idea that we've got a very different... In some ways a much simpler problem to solve. Our supply chain is not complicated. There aren't a whole lot of handoffs, right? Traceability can be hard when you've got lots and lots of handoffs, when there's a lot of on process changing hands, 14 times in some instances if you're a field grower. For us, we drive it directly to the distribution center or directly to the store and it's a single handoff. So traceability for us is much simpler. It has more to do with process steps than it does to do with who had it, right? Who had it at this point in the process.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:Do you think that's going to get more complicated as you get bigger and you have more farms? Is that going to become more complex and how will you deal with that?
Nate Storey, Plenty:I mean, I think managing those farms becomes more complex and the number of instances grows because we now have more farms. But as far as the actual process, the process itself doesn't get more complex. So if you think about it this way, if I was growing in a field and I had a farm in California and I'm managing multiple fields but we're aggregating all of that produce with the packing, at the packing stage and then shipping it out and it changes hands half a dozen times across half a dozen different retailers and ends up in stores all over the US, that's still quite complicated.
Nate Storey, Plenty:Whereas with the Plenty farms, because we're very close, generally, relatively close to the distribution centers, each farm is going to be servicing certain distribution centers, certain stores. So when you look at it kind of like the nodes, if you were to diagram it out, farm to distribution center, distribution center to stores compared to the insane logistics problems that many of the field growers have to manage, where it's a hard, hard problem. Our problems are relatively simple. There's just not that many exchanges, right? There's not that many transactions.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:Yeah. That makes sense. Are there any problems that Plenty or anyone else that's in controlled environment ag has around food safety that are different than outside? Are there problems that are more unique to CEA growing around food safety?
Nate Storey, Plenty:Yeah. I mean, I think if there are, they're more around process steps, but even then I don't think that indoor necessarily has any more or any less problems. I think that's simplification of the idea of how pathogens could get into the system. Everyone has to be vigilant. Everyone has to be really careful. The difference is the simplicity of the system, right? And the ability to measure. So I think if there's one thing that's probably true for indoor growers or Plenty at least is we tend to over-index on testing. So because we have this super tight contained facility, because we have these really well-defined process steps, we're able to test with more frequency and more often. And one of the drawbacks of testing is that you learn things, right?
Vonnie Estes, PMA:Yeah. Yeah.
Nate Storey, Plenty:You actually have to do something with that data. And so I think the reality is we just have a much more granular view of say the microbiology of the system. And even in systems that are super sterile, there's always a microbiology no matter what. Germ theory, everything is everywhere, right? And the reality is that no matter where you go, no matter what kind of a system you're working with, there will always be a microbiology. So we just need to make sure it's the right microbiology. Is it safe? Is it a good microbiology? And so all of that to say, I think for a lot of field growers, the testing equipment just doesn't exist to engage in the kind of testing that we can engage in, in a controlled facility with a lab onsite, right?
Nate Storey, Plenty:It's a different scenario. And I think that lack of information in the field both represents a risk in terms of not necessarily always knowing what is in or on your product. It also mitigates the risk of knowing and having to respond to it, right? We just don't have enough historical data to understand how we balance our reaction to some of these things in the field. So often times we end up with these scenarios where it lands on a shelf and some gets sick, and then they do a bunch of testing and we've got big recall on our hands. It's definitely worse in the long run than testing in the field and understanding what's going on and just holding stuff back.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:So what did you have to do? I hadn't even thought of this. That because your ability to constantly test and you're able to see things at a much lower level and to follow them through, what did you have to learn and was there anybody else doing that research? Or did you just have to build this whole body of research yourself of really understanding, ""We've never seen this pathogen or this microorganism""? It's not necessarily a pathogen, maybe pathogen to the plant, but just that whole body of knowledge probably didn't exist before you started looking, right?
Nate Storey, Plenty:Yeah. I mean, so people have been doing research on the microbiology of hydroponic systems for a while. That being said, every little ecosystem is different, no two are alike. They can be the exact same system side-by-side and they might have a slightly different microbiology. So some existed, and it was helpful in a very broad sense and unhelpful in a narrow sense. So there's just a lot that we have to learn about our farms, right? How they behave, how they work. And they're very safe. They're very safe in terms of the microbiology that we have. They tend to be closer to the sterile end of the spectrum than the super diverse into the spectrum.
Nate Storey, Plenty:And that's frankly the way we want it. We clean the floors, we sterilize the equipment between harvest, right? We're sterilizing everything. So that's how we want it. That's not necessarily to say that it's a good or a bad thing. That's just the management approach that we've taken. And learning how that impacts food safety, learning how that impacts the microbiology of the system has been quite the learning process for us. We are fortunate to have a system that allows us to collect data constantly, test constantly, and really keep tabs on the system microbiology, as opposed to more of the black box approach that frankly we're stuck with in a lot of other production systems.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:And you have everything all in one place too, which has got to be a big advantage. So you're growing and any processing, any packaging, anything, it's not moving across town or it doesn't have to go through a bunch of different steps.
Nate Storey, Plenty:That's right.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:So that control has got to be a huge advantage from a food safety point of view as well.
Nate Storey, Plenty:Yeah. Again, just going back to this concept of simplification, right? It's like when you simplify the problem, there's only, say two transactions rather than 15 transactions. The number of places where something can go wrong, or the number of points where there can be contamination or the number of processes to audit, or what have you, right? It's a fraction. It's a fraction of what it is otherwise. So we just have a simpler problem.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:Yeah. You've talked a little bit about traceability. So let's move a little bit about traceability and data. So how can traceability and enhanced data transparency make the CEA sector more responsive to food safety concerns?
Nate Storey, Plenty:Yeah. That's a good question. I mean, I think the thing to point out about traceability is traceability is typically used to try and understand where a problem happened after the fact, right?
Vonnie Estes, PMA:That's awful.
Nate Storey, Plenty:It's kind of like the police, right? They show up after the crime has been committed. If you're the person getting robbed, the cops aren't that helpful in that moment, right? And so traceability is the same way. Usually something has happened and we've got a recall, we've got something on our hands and we've got to go back and figure out in the produce industry, right? So at Plenty, we've taken a little bit of a different approach and we've said traceability is very helpful in terms of food safety, yes, and always managing our food safety, but it's also very helpful at managing our system and our system efficiency.
Nate Storey, Plenty:So for us traceability is as much about system efficiency and material management as it is about human health and safety. And I think the thing to point out there is in most systems traceability again, is something that's helpful generally after the fact. At Plenty because we're able to pair it with this testing, right? Constant testing, just constant, constant, constant testing, it becomes a tool for really rapid diagnosis if we see something that's weird or off, or if we see a shift in system microbiology, or if we see ATP counts go up somewhere, right? So we basically have a unique opportunity to leverage traceability. And the other thing that I'd say is we've simplified the traceability problem at Plenty with our architecture, right?
Nate Storey, Plenty:So it's not like we're coming into an existing system that's already complex and trying to bring a traceability system to try and understand a super complicated thing. We basically just said, ""Hey, what's the more simple form, right? How do we get to a more simple form?"" And that doesn't make the traceability obsolete per se, but it does make it maybe a little less critical to understanding the system, right? Because the system is just more understandable. It is simple. There's only a couple of transactions there. I guess that's how I would describe our approach to traceability. Consumers want honesty, consumers want transparency, consumers want to know that their food is safe.
Nate Storey, Plenty:And I think we've used labels for a very long time to try and communicate those things, but I see a world and a future where consumers want to be able to scan a barcode and see how the product was grown, scan a barcode and see who grew it, where it was grown, how it was handed off, whether or not it was cold chain compliant or not. I see a future where people want to be able to take more of a firsthand approach to auditing the food that they eat. I don't think that's everyone, but I think that's an occasional thing that people want. And in a world where we're moving towards more transparency, I'd bet on it rather than bet against it.
Nate Storey, Plenty:So regardless of the system that folks are using to produce, traceability is something they should be investing in. I will also say the fact that we have some of the food safety incidents on the rise, I think in my opinion indicates we need to invest in more testing as well. So in the same vein as pairing testing and traceability for field producers, that's something that we need, is rapid modular testing.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:Mm-hmm (affirmative). So we've been at a huge time of disruption with COVID and then some regulatory changes. How can data make the CEA sector more resilient in these times of disruption?
Nate Storey, Plenty:Yeah. That's a good question. I think there's a lot of things that we can learn from the last year and a half as it relates to resiliency and the food supply system. Some of those things have to do with things like traceability and data, knowing what is where, right? There were all sorts of logistics breakdowns the last year. And a lot of that is a data problem. A lot of that was a labor problem, right? In some places we just didn't have the people. So investing in more autonomous systems or systems that can basically function in the absence of human supervisors, that's important.
Nate Storey, Plenty:And then location. So at Plenty our goal has been to solve these by putting farms close to distribution centers, minimizing the amount of labor, minimizing the amount of complexity that can interfere with us, growing the product and then handing it directly off to the retailer and then they hand it off directly to the consumer, that's the simplest possible process, right? And so when we think about resilient food systems, I think it's important to think about simple food systems. Could we just make these super complex things a little bit complicated and reduce the number of dependencies in the system? So if we're dependent on constant labor prices and constant labor supply, that's not a good bet looking forward.
Nate Storey, Plenty:The other thing I think really changed was consumers started to think about their health and they started to think about their safety, and maybe they're thinking about it through the lens of COVID, but I think that it's going to transfer to the things that people choose to put in their bodies, to the food that they eat. And as people moved home, we saw it in our sales. Our sales went through the roof, right? As people started staying home and started cooking for themselves, they started investing in healthy food. And I think understanding what they're eating, who grew, where it came from is an important part of that decision making process for some folks. And certainly the folks that are the advocates, right? The folks that are quite vocal and the folks that are really involved with promoting fresh fruits and vegetables, fresh, healthy food.
Nate Storey, Plenty:So I think consumer behavior is another thing to consider here and the speed of change in that behavior. A lot of things happened overnight with COVID. And I think we need to get used to consumer demands, for change. Consumer demands for things being something that we have to respond to. So when we think about data systems and how flexible they are responsive, how we're able to audit, where something was and who was touching it and who handed it off, that's another thing to keep in mind looking forward. So all of that to say, it's just a long ramble there. We have this tendency as humans to engage in this additive improvement, right? So we're like, ""Oh, we've got to figure out how to make the system safer. Let's add things to it."" And what that results in is a super complex system.
Nate Storey, Plenty:And it gets to the point where we just hold out this, ""Hope machine learning AI is going to come in and solve this problem for us. It's too complicated for humans now."" And maybe the question doesn't need to be too complicated for humans, right? At its core, do we really need to make this thing so complex that we need insanely complex computer programs to actually help us understand it? And I think the answer at Plenty is no. As we start to think about how we grow the world's capacity to grow fresh fruits and vegetables, I think we can grow that capacity with a simpler system, with a system that empowers producers, empowers consumers and really makes it something that's understandable.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:Yeah. Those are a bunch of different great points. I think certainly around consumers it's very important. And we at PMA we've seen a lot of changes in consumers and how they want to get their food and how they think about their food. And I know for myself personally, in the beginning of COVID where we went to the grocery store a lot less frequently, just the decision of what do you buy because I'm not coming back for 10 more days. And so those types of behaviors and looking at how long will this lettuce last on my refrigerator, or how long will this strawberry last in my refrigerator? And so I think just those types of changes in behavior and people wanting to buy online and have it delivered, we saw an ability to really be able to react to those types of things.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:And I think that made for a lot more resilience. And at the same time, a lot of consumers really got to see what does our supply chain look like when there was people plowing onions back and in the field because they couldn't go to food service or milk being dumped. I think that really highlighted to a lot of consumers what our supply chain looks like and how important it is on food.
Nate Storey, Plenty:Yeah.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:Yeah.
Nate Storey, Plenty:And we were all really in the hands of these complicated logistics, right? And anyone could produce or could be the victim.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:Yeah.
Nate Storey, Plenty:Any group with consumers could be the victim of inefficiencies that jump out.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:Yeah. So what technology do you see still needs to be developed to decrease the number of food safety recalls and produce? And this can be indoor or outdoor grown. Just what do you think we should be working on from a technology point of view to solve this better?
Nate Storey, Plenty:Yeah. I mean, I think for me there's probably three things that matter the most. And I harp on this with my teams a lot, right? You have to make something easier, people won't do it. You have to make it easy or people will take shortcuts and do it wrong or they'll figure out some way to cheat the system to make it easier. So human beings are always optimizing for conservation of energy. So I think number one is testing and I'm still amazed at the lack of really effective testing for pathogens that exist. So-
Vonnie Estes, PMA:Onsite testing.
Nate Storey, Plenty:Onsite. That's right. In the field. So starting in the field, right? Again, traceability is fine. Traceability is great, but it just tells you what is and it's usually after the fact. And so it tells you where something was. It doesn't necessarily tell you the state of the product at that position in the supply chain. So when we think about the fundamental problem here, it's like no one knows whether there's pathogens on the product or not until late in the game. And so if we had modular testing, they could go to the fields, it could be very effective. That would be awesome.
Nate Storey, Plenty:We at Plenty we've got the advantage of we've got a lab on site, right? We have the lab in the field, if you will. And I think for us, that's awesome. It means that we can do that rapid testing. It means that we can understand what is true and we can walk anywhere in the farm and tell you what the state of that product is. But for the field which needs to keep producing to meet demand, testing is so, so important. And there just aren't any great solutions today that are rapid, modular and really effective. And then second on traceability, this is just a super simple thing, but automated data entry.
Nate Storey, Plenty:Just figure out ways to make data entry automated, fast, effective, easy for people. And the folks especially who are in the field, this is the last thing that they want to think about. Make it easy. So this is technology that already exists, RFID tags, barcodes, the systems around managing and tracking things. And then I think lastly integrated data systems. So getting people to share their data and building data systems that transfer. Before we were talking about blockchain, but these ways of understanding where something came from in a way that's integrated, retailers, producers, everyone.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:So these aren't Nobel Prize level technology discoveries. These are mostly adoption and just paying attention to putting solutions together that people can use, right?
Nate Storey, Plenty:These are not sexy.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:Yeah. That's the area that people don't want to invest in, I'm afraid, but...
Nate Storey, Plenty:Yeah.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:Well, I think we have some questions from the audience, right? Beth, were you going to [crosstalk 00:31:47] those? Yeah. Okay.
Beth:We do. So the first question comes in from Sean Moore who asked, ""What forms of technology does Plenty use today?
Nate Storey, Plenty:Oh, that's a really big question. I mean, we're a technology company and so there are a lot of technologies that we use that we don't work on. So think industrial robots, industrial controls, that kind of thing. There's a lot of technology that we've developed because it's either something the market didn't provide or couldn't provide for our specific application. So these are things like, I would say our growing technology, vertical towers and the conveyance systems and just the way that we manage things, the architecture itself of the farm. We have lighting systems that we've designed, HVAC systems, air management, environmental management systems.
Nate Storey, Plenty:We have nutrient and fluids control systems. Then we have genetics, which I consider technology. It's proprietary genetics that we've paired to match with those environmental technologies. And then on top of genetics there's the classic GEM, right? We've layered all of these management technologies that we've developed in order to help make sure that that match of genetics and environment is perfect. So farmOS, sensor and sensing systems. We're using machine learning and AI in some instances, data management storage, data pipeline, and that kind of thing. So everything from the hardware to the software and then the plant software of genetics.
Beth:That's a lot. But yeah, it keeps everything moving, that's for sure. So another question came in, how often do you use pesticides in CEA? Is it needs-based only or preventive as well?
Nate Storey, Plenty:Yeah. At Plenty we don't use pesticides on our crops. Again, just going back to this concept of simplicity... I know that's not true for all producers, but for Plenty it is. Going back to this concept of simplicity, right? If you can keep the pests out of the farm then you have a much lessened likelihood of having to use pesticides, right? We do our production cycle, is always about 12 days. And so there are very few pests and pathogens that can keep up with those types of... We just outstripped the life cycle of most of our insects, pests. We don't have weeds. So all we're left with is fungal and bacterial pathogens. And those we control with air filtration and fluids filtration, right? And so we can manage all of the different risks to our crops with means other than pesticides or insecticides.
Beth:Awesome. Thank you. Next question is, are you having a challenge finding enough of the right people to fill this roles at Plenty? Are you partnering with any university programs to ensure the skills needed in the future to allow other companies to get on the indoor farming bandwagon or idea, concept here?
Nate Storey, Plenty:Yeah. I mean, I think the answer to that is yes. And I think there are a lot of young, talented, amazing people that are lined up to work at these places. The job market right now is particularly tough. So yeah, I mean, we could always use more. I'd say that the place where we've historically really struggled is to bring in really great mature growers who had experiences in traditional industry. The reality is, ag-tech is tough because you have agricultural problems and you have this partner in a much more conservative established industry.
Nate Storey, Plenty:And so getting good growers to the door who can come in, have an open-mind and engage with you on new technology is a pretty tough thing. Most growers tend to be more conservative in their outlook and their approach on technology and getting their engagement has been hard. But we're slowly getting there as people start to realize we're a real thing and we're going to be around for awhile. We're getting a little bit more of a response.
Beth:I was going to ask you if it's changing over time and you're seeing more of understanding and acceptance of new ways.
Nate Storey, Plenty:It is. It's slowly getting there. We just keep putting out this message, it's like, we're not here to replace the field. We're here to build agricultural capacity on top of the field. Everyone has to produce. There's no one in the world who can slack off here for the next 50, 60 years. The population of this planet, the rising middle-class, none of those things allows anyone to take a break. So there's good job security in ag moving forward. And I think as people start to realize this isn't a competitive thing where we're going to take out the field growers and we're not competing. As people start to realize that they realize, ""Oh, well, maybe there's an opportunity here for more collaboration. Maybe we can share people and share ideas and get better together."" So we're getting there.
Beth:Well, and one question that comes to my mind too is domestically versus internationally. So is there more or less interest particularly in the EU or in other countries? What's the difference that you might be seeing relative to interest domestically versus internationally?
Nate Storey, Plenty:Yeah. I mean, there are massive differences, some of which are cultural, some of which are societal. Some of which are a direct result of the pattern of development to that area. So when we look across the world, there's interest from everywhere, right? The reality is that the world supply of fresh fruits and vegetables can't keep up with demand. That is a fact. And people are not consuming enough fresh fruits and vegetables. And so when we think about what we have to do, we've got to triple the current supply of fresh fruits and vegetables in order to meet that need. How are we going to do that? Right? And I think everyone's wrapping their heads around that.
Nate Storey, Plenty:Obviously some places in the world are way ahead of us where we have plenty of agricultural capacity. You go to Saudi Arabia, you go to Shanghai, China, you go to Singapore and they're thinking about food security constantly because they don't have our capacity. So for them, this is a no-brainer, right? It just makes perfect sense. So I think there are areas of the world that are going to adopt this very, very quickly. And they're going to be areas of the world that are slower simply because there's less pressure on them from a supply standpoint.
Vonnie Estes, PMA:I think what we're going to see moving forward is a blurring of the lines between indoor and outdoor. We are already seeing partnerships like Plenty and Driscoll's, for example, between outdoor companies and indoor companies. There are both ways to produce food with their own sets of benefits and challenges, which vary by growing regions and crop. We will see growers produce food in ways that are best for them in terms of labor, water, availability, and markets. That's it for this episode of PMA Takes on Tech.

Food safety is one of the chief concerns of all who work in the produce industry. The expectations and requirements for those who handle produce continue to proliferate and can be, at times, bewildering.
Under the Food Safety Modernization Act (FSMA), nearly all farm/ranch and food facility operators are required to implement food safety programs. Even small operations exempt from regulations are legally responsible for providing consumers with safe food. With all of the requirements coming from regulatory bodies and buyers, plus heightened food safety concerns from consumers, advocacy groups and others,now is the time to take a closer look at the basic building blocks of a robust food safety program.
To better understand those building blocks, we will first review the following basic principles of food safety:
Evaluate your risks.
Prioritize your risks.
Address each significant risk to minimize or eliminate that risk.
Validate what you do to address each risk. Use available science.
Document what you do. (If it isn’t written down, it didn’t happen.)
As we get started on this discussion of food safety building blocks, it is important to define some frequently used terms:
GAP
Good Agricultural Practices were originally outlined by the FDA in the 1998 publication“Guide to Minimize Microbial Food Safety Hazards for Fresh Fruits and Vegetables”. GAPsare designed to identify potential pathogen contamination risks and suggest potential risk  management practices.
GMP
Good Manufacturing Practices come from the Code of Federal Regulations 21 CFR110. GMPs identify contamination risks and risk management practices in packing, processing and holding operations.
SOP
Standard Operating Procedures. SOPs are written protocols for specific activities or tasks in an operation. An example of an SOP might be the written description of how to measure sanitizer concentration in wash water. The value of a written SOP is to ensure that critical practices are performed consistently.
SSOP
Sanitation Sanitary Operating Procedures. SSOPs are written protocols describing howfacilities and equipment are washed and sanitized. An SSOP includes a listing of thecleaning and sanitation chemicals to be used, the appropriate concentration levels, themethods to be followed, and how sanitation effectiveness is measured.
HACCP
Hazard Analysis Critical Control Point program. HACCP is a preventive system in which every step in the manufacturing, storage and distribution of a product is systematically evaluated for microbiological, physical and chemical hazards. An HACCP program is legally required in the fresh juice, meat, poultry, seafood and food canning industries.
HARPC
Hazard Analysis and Risk-Based Preventive Controls program; subpart C of the Current Good Manufacturing Practice, Hazard Analysis, and Risk-Based Preventive Controls for Human Food (the Preventive Controls Rule).
Like HACCP, HARPC is a mechanism to identify and manage microbiological, physical and chemical hazards. But unlike HACCP, HARPC addresses all significant hazards whether or not they are quantifiable. Instead of critical limits to control hazards at critical control points (CCPs), HARPC determines preventive measures to minimize or eliminate significant hazards at both CCPs and non-CCP areas. The hallmark of HARPC is a food safety plan including both a supply-chain program and a recall plan.
HAZARD
A biological, chemical or physical agent having the potential to cause illness or injury.
RISK
An estimate of the likely occurrence of a hazard.
VALIDATION
The process of evaluating scientific and technical evidence to prove that a controlmeasure(s) or the food safety plan as a whole, when properly implemented, can effectively manage the identified hazards.
VERIFICATION
The process of determining whether a control measure, or combination of control measures, is operating as intended.
How do I perform a risk assessment?
A comprehensive risk assessment is fundamental to understanding the risks of your operation. While your risks may be the same as or similar to other operations in your industry sector, some will be unique to you.
In addition, performing a risk assessment is a powerful educational tool that helps managers better understand the risks inherent in your operations—and the importance of addressing them. For these reasons, it is important that your team perform a risk assessment. Do not rely on outside consultants to do it for you, even though they may be working with, and supporting, your team’s efforts.
To perform a comprehensive risk assessment, start by assembling a team. Members might come from operations, quality assurance, maintenance, senior management and/or any other staff that are appropriate. Including a consultant or employee familiar with food safety science may also be helpful.
Next, develop an accurate flow diagram. Include all unit operations, any inputs (such as chemicals, water and ice) and packaging. This can be done for farm operations as well as for harvesting, packing, cooling or processing operations. After confirming that the flow diagram is an accurate reflection of your actual processes, number each step in the process. For example, “Receiving” might be #1, “QA Evaluation” might be #2, and so forth.
After numbering each step, brainstorm with your team and list all of the physical, chemical and biological hazards that could occur at each process step. For example, a biological hazard might be contamination by a human pathogen or insect. A chemical hazard could include excess sanitizing agents or agricultural chemicals not labeled for that product. A physical hazard might be pieces of glass or small stones, dirt or materials that could cause injury if consumed. The easiest way to perform this evaluation is to develop a simple table. List the potential hazards across the top, then list the steps in your process in the first column, as shown below:
Process Step
Biological
Physical
Chemical
#1 Receiving
Salmonella from raw product contaminated in the field
Insect parts
Mold on fruit
Rocks
Wood silvers from pallets
Unregistered pesticide residues
#2 QA Evaluation
Human Pathogens from hands of inspectors
--
--
#3 Dumping onto conveyor
Cross-contamination from conveyor
Plastic fragments from conveyor parts
Residue from cleaning chemicals
After potential hazards have been discussed and described for every process or handling step, evaluate which are reasonably likely to occur without preventive controls. This phase is called the risk assessment; risk being the probability that a hazard will occur. For example, on a farm the team may identify flooding as a potential hazard. But if that farm is not in a flood zone, and historically has not experienced flooding, the team may decide that the risk is not significant, and does not need further consideration.
After identifying significant hazards, the team then determines which preventive controls can manage or reduce that risk. In other words, for every significant risk there must be a program or activity implemented to reduce or eliminate it.

Biol = B, Chem = C, Phys = P
For example, there may be a significant risk that raw produce could arrive already contaminated with Salmonella. If so, the team might require all suppliers of those products to demonstrate that they have audited GAP programs to minimize the risk.
Or, if the team has identified a significant risk of cross-contamination during washing, implement a wash water sanitation program. Most risks will be addressed through what HACCP plans have typically called prerequisite programs. Although HARPC does not use this terminology, the FSMA includes many of the same components as traditional prerequisite programs—GAP, GMP, cleaning, sanitation, worker training, and general hygiene requirements. These requirements will be described in more detail later on.
How do I develop or evaluate a GAP program?
Good agricultural practices, or GAPs, are a series of on-farm activities that address the main areas of concern where contamination may occur. Those areas have been outlined by the FDA in their 1998 publication “Guide to Minimize Microbial Food Safety Hazards for Fresh Fruits and Vegetables” (the GAP Guide). They were codified in Title 21, Part 112—“Standards for the Growing, Harvesting, Packing, and Holding of Produce for Human Consumption” (the Produce Safety Rule) under the FSMA.
Although not legally binding like the Produce Safety Rule, the GAP Guide contains more details for developing food safety programs than the Rule does. University extension programs and the FDA have developed and made available many other supplementary materials describing GAPs. In general, however, these guidance documents tend to be broad, and focus on areas of concern rather than specific actions.
For some commodities, such as leafy greens, melons, tomatoes, citrus, herbs, green onions, potatoes, mushrooms and others, there are specific documents that provide more detailed guidance. The USDA National Organic Program also provides more details. However, performing a risk assessment as described above is an excellent way to describe and address the risks for your commodities in your particular organization.
It is critically important that each operator of a farm, harvesting or packing operation, cooling facility, processing plant, distribution center or repacking operation takes the responsibility for assessing the risks in their operation. Your knowledge of operations, and how you handle products, will provide the most useful assessment. The guidance documents and Produce Safety Rule provisions can then provide such specifics as water quality standards, composting procedures and microbial standards, setbackdistances from domestic animals, and others.
We have already referenced the FDA’s GAP Guide. In essence, most produce food safety standards, including the Produce Safety Rule requirements and commodity-specific guidance, have their roots in this original guidance document. In the FDA’s GAP Guide, the agency outlined eight specific principles, shown below:
BASIC PRINCIPLES OF GOOD AGRICULTURAL PRACTICES (GAPs)
Prevention of microbial contamination of fresh produce is favored over reliance oncorrective actions once contamination has occurred.
To minimize microbial food safety hazards in fresh produce, growers or packers should use GAPs in those areas over which they have a degree of control while not increasing other risks to the food supply or the environment.
Anything that comes in contact with fresh produce has the potential of contaminating it. For most foodborne pathogens associated with produce, the major source of contamination is associated with human or animal feces.
Whenever water comes in contact with fresh produce, its source and quality dictate the potential for contamination.
Practices using manure or municipal biosolid wastes should be closely managed tominimize the potential for microbial contamination of fresh produce.
Worker hygiene and sanitation practices during production, harvesting, sorting, packing and transport play a critical role in minimizing the potential for microbial contamination of fresh produce.
Follow all applicable local, state and federal laws and regulations, or correspondingor similar laws, regulations or standards for operators outside the U.S. for agricultural practices.
Accountability at all levels of the agricultural environment (farm, packing facility,distribution center and transport operation) is important to a successful food safetyprogram. There must be qualified personnel and effective monitoring to ensure that all elements of the program function correctly and to help track produce back through the distribution channels to the producer.
There is less control of the environment on a farm or ranch than in an enclosed packinghouse or processing facility. For this reason, some risks may be difficult to address directly. Remember that the GAP Guide and the Produce Safety Rule say that the operator should use GAPs in those areas over which they have a degree of control. Nevertheless, it is not acceptable for a food safety program to ignore a significant risk simply because it is difficult or impossible to control.
A common example of such a risk on farms and ranches is the presence of birds, some of which carry human pathogenic bacteria. Birds can and do enter fields, and it is often impossible to prevent that. But if birds are a significant risk, a reasonable GAP program would minimize bird attractants, such as in-field standing water and debris. It would also recommend against growing in areas close to where birds gather, such as landfills and wetlands.
Finally, develop a program of pre-harvest evaluation to determine the extent and seriousness of bird activity. Looking for bird feces can be used to construct a decision tree regarding whether to sequester an area of a field and not harvest the crop or to divert it from the fresh market.
Decision trees can be a very useful tool in GAP programs, as well as in other food safety programs. They allow the criteria for food safety decisions to be thought through in advance without regard to production and market concerns. An example of a simple decision tree for presence of bird activity in a field might be:

Good Manufacturing Practices, or GMPs, are a series of rules regarding general cleanliness and hygiene for food handling facilities. GMPs, updated in 2015 as part of the FSMA, are published in the U.S. Federal Register (Code of Federal Regulations 21 CFR117) and have the force of law for off-farm packing operations and processors preparing ready-to-eat foods.
While harvest crews and on-farm packing and cooling operations are not subject to GMPs, provisions in the Produce Safety Rule are similar in nature and intent. In general terms, this statute mandates that food companies follow GMPs to assure the packing and processing environments are clean, and that no unacceptable substances enter the food product.
TOPICS ADDRESSED AS PART OF GMPs INCLUDE:
A summary of “GMPs for the 21st Century – Food Processing” can be found on the FDA website at: http://www.fda.gov/food/guidanceregulation/cgmp/ucm110877.htm
GMPs direct the operator to develop programs addressing:
Personnel
Plant and grounds
Sanitary operations
Sanitary facilities
Equipment and utensils
Processes and controls
Warehousing and distribution
Defect action levels
Within these categories, the GMPs describe activities referring to:
Maintenance and sanitation processes
Personal hygiene standards
Water supply
Pest control
Plant design and construction
Training
The following are some examples of GMPs referring to personnel:
Management must take all reasonable measures and precautions to ensure that workers exhibiting symptoms of illness are excluded from operations where food could potentially be contaminated.
All persons working in direct contact with food/food-contact surfaces mustconform to hygienic practices while on duty.
Outer garments must be suitable to the operation.
Workers must maintain adequate cleanliness.
Workers must wash their hands properly, and at appropriate times.
Examples of GMPs addressing buildings and facilities include:
Grounds are kept in a condition that will protect against contamination of food.
Areas in the facility’s vicinity that may provide harborage for pests are removed.
Adequate drainage is provided to prevent breeding places for pests.
Buildings and structure are suitable in size and design to facilitate maintenanceand sanitary operations.
Plants are constructed in such a manner as to prevent drip or condensatefrom fixtures, ducts and pipes.
Adequate steps are taken to exclude pests, etc.
GMPs are lengthy and quite specific. You should become familiar with them, and incorporate those that apply to your facilities and operations. Most of these requirements are simply common sense, but they are comprehensive and may have been missed in your current food safety programs.
How do I develop SOPs for my operation?
Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) are written instructions for performing standard tasks in a facility or on a farm. SOPs may cover any number of common activities, from pre-operation checklists to instructions for supervisors to check workers’ hands for cuts and lesions.
The SOPs remind everyone to perform necessary tasks. They also provide specific instructions as to what tasks to perform and how to perform them. A benefit of having written SOPs is that various workers can perform the tasks by following the SOP, even if they have not done so before. Another benefit is that the task is done consistently and does not change over time.
An SOP should address a specific task or series of tasks and the purpose of the tasks, it should specify who is responsible for the task, how often the task must be completed and what to do if the task was not or cannot be completed. An example of an SOP for entering a work area is:
SOP 1-01: Entering the Work Area
PURPOSE:To ensure that all persons entering the work area have taken the necessary precautions to prevent foodborne pathogens from contaminating the product.
SUBJECTS:All workers and visitors.
WHEN:Whenever work is in progress and food products are present.
PROCEDURE:
Only enter the work area if you are feeling healthy and well. Do not enter the workarea if you are coughing and/or sneezing, have an upset stomach, have an open and exposed cut or sore on your hands, or are otherwise feeling unwell.
Only enter the work area in clean shoes and clothing.
Remove all jewelry and other objects that might fall into food, equipment orcontainers. Only a plain wedding band is permitted.
Fix hairnet or other headgear.
Wash hands thoroughly following proper hand-washing procedures.
If applicable, put on smock or apron.
Use a hand sanitizer.
If applicable, put on clean gloves.
Anytime your hands become contaminated, leave the work area and follow steps 1–8 before re-entering.
Anytime you feel unwell, leave the work area. Do not return until you are feelinghealthy and well. Follow steps 1–8 before re-entering.
Such an SOP can be used to remind workers and supervisors to perform the tasks appropriate to ensuring the terms of the SOP. It can also be used as a checklist to document that the terms of the SOP have been completed. Constructing SOPs for common tasks helps ensure that they are completed correctly, consistently and in a timely manner.
How do I write and use an SSOP?
A Standard Sanitation Operating Procedure (SSOP) is an SOP specifically for cleaning and sanitation tasks. They address the pre-operational and operational procedures to prevent product contamination, and are a central building block of a rigorous food safety program.
Facility sanitation tasks are typically described as SSOPs. Each SSOP describes a specific task in the form of a detailed recipe for performing that task. The “recipe” should be detailed enough, and clear enough, so that a sanitation shift worker can follow the procedure and achieve a sanitary surface.
An SSOP should describe the task in detail from beginning to end. It should explain why that task is important and how often it must be completed. It should also list all tools and inputs needed to complete the task. An example of an SSOP is:
SANITATION OF CONVEYOR BELTS
GOAL:Prevent buildup of organic matter and microorganisms on conveyorsso that they do not become a source of contamination.
IMPORTANCE:Dirty conveyor belts can contaminate products that contact them.
FREQUENCY:Monthly
TOOLS AND EQUIPMENT:Potable water, hose, stiff plastic long-handled brush, soap, pressurized soap applicator, peroxide sanitizer, backpack sprayer, check sheet.
PROCEDURES:
Remove belts from conveyors.
Thoroughly rinse equipment, from top to bottom, with a pressure washer until all loose carrot sludge, bits and pieces have been removed.
Mix soap as follows: ______________
Apply soap with the pressurized soap sprayer.
Scrub vigorously to remove small pieces of carrot and to remove invisible films.
Rinse thoroughly a second time to remove all of the soap. The soap must be rinsed in order for the sanitizing solution (peroxide) to be effective.
Reinstall the belts.
Mix peroxide solution as follows: _______________
All of the belts must be sprayed with the peroxide solution. The sanitizing solution isapplied with a backpack sprayer.
The Sanitation Crew Chief then inspects all sanitized surfaces.
The Sanitation Crew Chief writes the time and date, and signs the sanitation log foreach individual belt. If any belt does not pass inspection, the Crew Chief notes that in the log and the crew must rewash and re-sanitize that belt until it passes inspection.
Replace belts.
After the task has been completed, the cleaned and sanitized surface can be swabbed and the swab sent to an appropriate lab for testing to verify the SSOP’s effectiveness. Swab tests, the most common method of conducting environmental monitoring, typically target indicator organisms such as Listeria species or environmental pathogens such as Listeria monocytogenes or Salmonella.
If the cleaning and sanitizing methods described in the SSOP are effective, the swab test result should show few or no viable bacteria on the swabbed surface. If, however, there are significant numbers of viable bacteria, then the SSOP is ineffective and sanitation methods need to be reevaluated and improved. In this way, all of the SSOPs can be improved and validated.
Having validated the SSOP, the sanitation team must follow its instructions, with confidence that the result will be sanitary surfaces. Such an approach of developing validated SSOPs for all cleaning and sanitation tasks results in a rigorous sanitation program that has been proven effective. The operator will thus have a high degree of confidence that the surfaces that have been cleaned and sanitized are, indeed, sanitary and reliably free of contaminants.
Another benefit of this approach is that it becomes unnecessary to constantly swab surfaces to verify that they are sanitary. The validated SSOP ensures that they are, as long as the sanitation crew faithfully follows the SSOP’s validated procedures. Revalidation of the SSOP is necessary if products, processes or procedures change.
In addition, periodic environmental monitoring as verification that the SSOP is still effective is important since microorganisms evolve and change their survival characteristics or may become resistant to the sanitizers in use. But for routine sanitation activities, swabbing frequency can be greatly reduced therebyreducing costs.
Many operators develop rotation schedules based on the potential contamination risks presented by different pieces of equipment, or the frequency which a specific piece of equipment demonstrates measurable microbial levels after sanitation. This approach to risk-based sanitation verification can be effective in monitoring the operation’s sanitary status by targeting known problem areas and managing testing costs.
How do I develop a HARPC program?
A Hazard Analysis and Risk-Based Preventive Controls (HARPC) program, required for processing and off-farm packing facilities under the Preventive Controls Rule, is very similar to Hazard Analysis Critical Control Point programs (HACCP) which have been legally required for the fresh juice, meat, poultry, seafood and food canning industries for some time now.
HACCP was originally developed for the American space program to minimize foodborne illness incidents for astronauts while in space. Like HACCP, HARPC is designed to identify opportunities for food contamination with physical, chemical or biological contaminants, and to establish control measures to prevent that contamination from occurring.
Rather than testing finished products in an effort to detect contaminants, HARPC and HACCP programs seek to systematically prevent them. The heart of a HARPC program is a systematic hazard analysis and corresponding preventive control measures plan based on a comprehensive risk assessment, as described above. Based on the risk assessment, HARPC seeks to identify areas in packing or processing operations that, if controlled, will significantly minimize or eliminate contamination risks. The PreventiveControls Rule’s provisions outline a comprehensive food safety program that includes HARPC and Good Manufacturing Practices (GMPs).
A food safety plan under HARPC includes seven components:
A written hazard analysis
Written preventive controls
Written supply-chain program
Written recall plan
Written procedures for monitoring implementation of the preventive controls
Written corrective actions
Written verification procedures
How to conduct a hazard analysis was described above. Identifying and implementing preventive measures for hazards requiring preventive controls is the next step. Under FSMA, preventive controls include process controls, food allergen controls and sanitation controls. Preventive controls are procedures, practices or processes implemented for any activity or area in packing and processing operations that, when not controlled, may result in a significant hazard.
After identifying hazards requiring preventive controls, the team must establish how often each control will be monitored, and who will be responsible for ensuring their implementation. A preventive control may be implemented at a critical control point (CCP), or at areas other than CCPs.
A CCP has certain characteristics that limit its use to well-defined situations where it is possible to quantifiably monitor by measuring a set of parameters or limits (called critical limits under HACCP) around a process. An example of a CCP is a wash water sanitizer level that can be measured using a test kit or strip.
After determining preventive control measures, corrective actions must be established in case the process is not operating according to the food safety plan. An example of a corrective action would be running all products back through a recalibrated metal detector if the metal detector is found to be outside the critical limits of its calibration.
A preventive control must also be verified as appropriate to its “nature and role in the facility’s food safety system.” Verification involves checking the implementation and effectiveness of the preventive control. Is the preventive control being monitored as required? Is it achieving the desired results?
Finally, a record-keeping system must be established. All aspects of the food safety plan under HARPC must be documented. Those responsible for development and implementation of the plan, specifically the preventive-controls-qualified individual, must be properly trained to fulfill those responsibilities.
There is no minimum or maximum number of areas requiring preventive controls in any given operation. What is important is that all potential hazards are minimized or eliminated. Bulb-onion packing operations may have as few as a half-dozen reventive control measures in a perfectly adequate food safety plan. Examples of preventive controls may be metal detection and water sanitizer activity. Both are process controls that prevent significant hazards and happen to be measurable, and their operation can be documented.
When considering applying these principles to a farm operation, one can see immediately the difficulty in controlling naturally occurring hazards on farms. For example, while bird droppings in an orchard may present a hazard from the spread of E. coli O157:H7 or Salmonella spp., process control may not prevent that hazard.
This would also be true of Listeria monocytogenes cells in soil. Though they may represent a potential hazard, it would not be appropriate to establish soil as a hazard requiring a preventive control, since it is not practical to measure the spores in soil or to control them through any known process.
In fact, most agricultural hazards cannot, and should not, be prevented through an HARPC- or HACCPbased food safety plan. Instead, the use of GAPs has been identified by the FDA and the produce industry as a more appropriate way to address these hazards.
How do I validate my food safety processes?
An important aspect of preventive controls is their validation. Validation is based on collecting and evaluating scientific and technical information to determine if food safety processes, practices and procedures, when properly implemented, will effectively control the hazards.
Validation of food safety activities provides evidence to support your choice of preventive measures in order to ensure your program is doing what it is intended to do. In the absence of validation, we operate in an environment of assumption and hope, neither of which can be expected to be consistently effective.
Validation may be as simple as administering exams to workers as follow-up to food safety training, or it may involve measuring bacteria in wash water to show that the sanitizer activity is sufficient. Validation of cleaning and sanitation processes was discussed above in the context of performing micro-swabs of sanitized surfaces to demonstrate the efficacy of an SSOP.
In light of the recent foodborne illness outbreaks and recalls of fruit contaminated with Listeria monocytogenes, it is especially important to validate cleaning and sanitation processes to keep this robust pathogen out of your facility. Validation is based on research and performance measurements and so forms the scientific bedrock on which food safety activities are based. As such, it is a key element of a rigorous food safety program.
Remember, you cannot manage what you cannot measure. It is important to be able to measure the effectiveness of your program, and identify and change any instances where your preventive controls are ineffective.
Despite the best-laid plans, things can go wrong. This is as true in food safety as in any other walk of life. When a contamination event does happen, or may have happened, it is crucial to limit the extent of the damage or consequences as rapidly as possible.
The consequences are almost always economic but may also extend to public health. Speed and completeness of response are thus very important. You can’t limit the effects of a contamination event if you don’t know where the contamination came from or where it went.
In recent years, response teams from the FDA and other regulatory agencies have been very frustrated by opaque distribution chains within the produce industry that prevent them from rapidly determining the source and extent of contamination, and associated threat to public health. There has been a great deal of pressure on the produce industry to adopt clearer and more uniform traceback and traceforward procedures to facilitate emergency response.
Much progress has been made to this end, including an industry-wide effort called the Produce Traceability Initiative (or PTI). This initiative is a collaboration of several industry organizations and members of the industry to introduce a uniform case-level traceability program that will follow products from field-to-retail or foodservice. You can learn more about this initiative at http://www.producetraceability.org.
Whatever form of traceback program you adopt, you must be able to track all of your products one step back and one step forward. In other words, where did you get the product and where did you send it? This applies not only to fruits and vegetables but also to packaging materials and any other products that you ship, such as croutons, plastic forks and the like. In addition, you want to be able to trace and recover those products rapidly and efficiently.
The evolving industry standard is that you should be able to account for 99% of a shipped product within two hours. Many operations have automated this process and can complete it within minutes. What you do not want to do is to find yourself in the midst of a recall trying to figure out where your products came from or where they went. It is far better to have evaluated your traceability and recall systems in advance and performed mock recalls to demonstrate that they work seamlessly.
To prepare for a recall, start by assembling a crisis management team. Identify a recall coordinator and a recall team. The recall coordinator should be knowledgeable about every aspect of the company’s operation. Team members should include production, quality assurance, marketing/sales and public relations.
A recall organizational chart should be constructed whereby the primary and alternate individuals and both their work and cell phone numbers are listed so they can be contacted immediately when a situation arises. The recall coordinator and team would be in charge of determining the extent of the product withdrawal and releasing statements to the customers involved, governmental agencies, and press.
Establish a means of product tracking and customer identification.The law already requires this, and there are many commercial and industryresources to help structure the program. Then, test the program to makesure that it functions smoothly, even under the worst circumstances. Recallsdon’t happen when they are convenient to you. They may well happen ona Friday night, a Sunday morning or on Christmas Eve. Are you prepared torespond at all times and under any circumstances? If not, you need to revisityour traceability/recall program and make sure that it is robust. Remember,a smooth and efficient trace-and-recall process may someday save yourcompany from ruin.
How can I use micro-testing to enhance my programs?
Over the past decade, there has been increasing pressure to test fresh fruits, vegetables and nuts for microorganisms. Much of this pressure has come from customers, especially large buying organizations. While testing for microorganisms can have a place in a food safety program, there are significant limitations to testing. You would do well to understand the power and the limitations of your proposed sampling and testing plans before embarking on a testing program.
While testing can yield useful information, it can also confuse, mislead and serve as a false basis for expensive decisions. The first thing to understand about testing for microorganisms on fresh produce or in produce environments is that you might find them. If you start looking for microorganisms, you had better have a plan of action in place, in case you find them.
There are several legitimate purposes for micro-testing of fresh produce. The first is because a customer requests or requires tests. A second is to detect the possible presence of pathogens. Another is to validate process elements through indicator organism detection. Yet another purpose is to model or understand a system’s microbiological ecology.
Finally, microbial testing can be used to track the fate of indicator organisms to better understand the system’s microbial dynamics. Before embarking on a micro-testing program, it is essential to clearly define the purpose(s) of testing as the structure of the test will be informed by the testing goals.
The choice of targeted test organism will largely depend on testing goals. In the produce industry, most water testing relies on detection of an indicator organism, like generic E. coli, as a surrogate for fecal contamination. Since E. coli is thought to often be associated with animal or human feces, it is likely to be present in water containing fecal contamination.
While E. coli is not necessarily fecal in origin, and the presence of generic E. coli does not necessarily mean there are human pathogens present, it indicates a likelihood of their presence since most food- and water-borne pathogens are fecal in origin. Testing for individual pathogens may be more difficult and more expensive than testing for generic E. coli, and testing for a single pathogen might miss the presence of others. Hence, E. coli tends to be the test organism of choice.
In some cases, tests for total coliforms or for fecal coliforms will take the place of generic E. coli tests. Coliforms are a group of bacteria characterized by their cylindrical shape. Fecal coliforms, a subset of coliform bacteria, grow at temperatures found in warm-blooded animals. While coliforms and fecal coliforms may be fecal in origin, many are not. Many coliforms and some fecal coliforms are common inhabitants of agricultural soils, and are not associated with feces at any part of their life cycle. Therefore, testing for coliforms and/or fecal coliforms is not recommended since presence of these bacteria may not indicate fecal contamination—making test results ambiguous.
To validate the efficacy of a wash water sanitizing chemical, one might test for total plate count (TPC), also sometimes called aerobic plate count. This test enumerates aerobic bacterial populations that may be present in the water. Since an effective water sanitizer should kill most such bacteria on contact, the TPC should be at, or near, zero. If it is not, then the sanitizer is not exhibiting the desired efficacy. Similarly, tests to validate the efficacy of environmental sanitizers usually test for TPC.
Some restaurant chains or other foodservice providers are asking produce suppliers to test for specific pathogens to keep contaminated produce lots out of the supply chain. In most cases, they request tests for Salmonella (of which there are thousands of different forms, or serotypes) and for E. coli O157:H7, a very virulent pathogenic form of E. coli infrequently found on lettuce, spinach, basil and other leafy vegetables.
Salmonella has been a problem on tomatoes, melons, mangoes, sprouts and many other products. Since these two pathogens have accounted for a large proportion of foodborne illness outbreaks associated with produce, they are the objects of most pathogen testing.
Finally, there are environmental pathogens—defined by the FDA as pathogens capable of surviving and persisting within manufacturing, processing, packing and holding environments such that food may be contaminated and result in foodborne illness if consumed. There is also the special case of the environmental pathogen, Listeria monocytogenes (L. monocytogenes).
Since it often becomes established in handling and processing facilities, many facilities perform L. monocytogenes-specific tests. L. monocytogenes, a natural inhabitant of soils, can survive for long periods and grow in soil and on plant material within a broad range of pH and temperatures. Once established in a processing plant, it is difficult to eradicate. It survives primarily in cool and wet areas such as drains, pipes, refrigeration units, and areas where condensate forms and collects. Since Listeria may be repeatedly introduced into processing facilities via incoming raw produce, rigorous sanitation of those areas is necessary.
L. monocytogenes may not cause major changes in the produce that a consumer could detect. So there is particular concern about the virulence (ability to cause disease) of L. monocytogenes in susceptible populations. When consumed in low numbers, L. monocytogenes can cause illness and even death in infants, pregnant women and immune-compromised individuals. Thus, most processing facility operators sample and test areas that may harbor Listeria species to verify that their sanitation processes are effectively excluding it. In the Preventive Controls Rule, the FDA refers to this type of testing as “environmental monitoring” and includes it as a means to meet verification requirements under HARPC.
So what is the problem with testing for microorganisms? None at all, if your testing program is meant to verify effectiveness of, or validate, a preventive control measure or process such as wash water sanitation or cleaning/sanitizing procedures.
Problems arise when looking for specific microorganisms, such as human pathogens, that are typically not uniformly distributed on produce or in the environment. They may be found in some parts of a field, but not in others, or on some individual fruit or vegetable and not on others. This makes sampling and testing difficult and complicated.
The probability of finding what you are looking for (if it is present), depends largely on the ability to test enough samples to find it. In the case of human pathogens on raw products in the field, or on finished products in a packing or processing facility, they are usually not present at all. If they are present, they may be unevenly distributed and present in low numbers. This makes them difficult to find, even when using the most sensitive of tests.
If, for example, Salmonella occurs on one melon out of every hundred, it would take a lot of test samples to detect it. This is the central problem of pathogen testing. While there are very fast, very sensitive test methods that can detect pathogens, the number of samples required may be so great that testing is impractical.
The difficulty of developing a sampling program that could reliably detect low-level pathogen contamination has been likened to finding a needle in a haystack. But it can also be described statistically. If a pathogen is present on produce or in the produce environment (a rare event), it may very well be present only sporadically and at a low frequency.
Years of testing by many companies and agencies show this to be generally so. The International Commission on the Microbiological Criteria for Foods points out that if you were to take 60 samples from a lot that was known to be contaminated at the 0.5% level, you would have a 74% probability of accepting this contaminated lot—and not detect the contamination.
Let’s take a look at this example below:

DEFECT LEVEL: 0.5%SAMPLE UNITS TESTED: 60Analysis: There is a 74% probability that all 60 samples will be found negative, and the lot will be accepted. So even after testing 60 samples from the lot, there is only a 26% probability that the pathogen will actually be found. A sample size of 100 would still miss it 61% of the time.
This simple statistical argument highlights the pitfalls of pathogen testing. You will probably not find it, even in the rare cases when it is there. If you don’t find it, you may believe that the product is safe when it is not. Therefore, testing for pathogens is an expensive and generally ineffective way to assure the safety of fresh fruits and vegetables.
Before embarking on any testing program, you must understand the implications of the results and have a plan of action, in case results are undesirable. In the case of pathogen testing, all products should be held so that they can be destroyed if a pathogen is detected.
Water tests should be conducted prior to the use of that water so that alternative sources, or alternative management schemes, can be employed if the water does not meet the microbiological specification. Sanitation chemicals and processes should be validated in advance, in case they are shown to be ineffective under some environmental conditions. Whatever the test, the operator should always have a plan of action before testing.
How do I implement an effective sanitation program?
With recent occurrences of foodborne illness outbreaks attributed to Listeria monocytogenes, some of which were associated with contaminated produce, the FDA has paid close attention to this particular environmental pathogen. As previously noted, Listeria, as an environmental pathogen, may be repeatedly introduced into cooling, packing, processing, storage and distribution facilities via incoming raw produce, equipment and foot traffic.
To prevent transient Listeria from developing resident populations in the facility, rigorous sanitation of those areas where the bacteria is likely to survive is essential. This involves establishing a written sanitation program, training employees to consistently implement the program and verifying its effectiveness with environmental monitoring.
Both cleaning and sanitizing methods and agents play a critical role. Choosing effective cleaning and sanitizing agents depends on operation-specific factors, such as the materials used to construct the facility and equipment. For example, some sanitizing chemicals may be corrosive depending on the materials used to construct your plant and/or equipment.
To determine which agents are best for your operations, consult with your chemical supplier. Cleaning and sanitizing methods are more standardized, but may be unique to a particular chemical and/or piece of equipment.
Routine cleaning and sanitizing is critical to avoiding biofilm formation. Biofilms are especially difficult to eliminate once they have formed. They are a leading factor in turning transient environmental pathogens into resident bacterial populations within a facility.
For example, we considered an example of an SSOP for sanitizing conveyor belts. SSOPs should be developed for all your equipment and areas of your facility where environmental pathogens were determined to be a significant hazard. This includes all food-contact surfaces, as well as non-foodcontact surfaces that may serve as a reservoir for environmental pathogens such as L. monocytogenes. As noted earlier, Listeria prefer cool, wet environments such as drains, pipes, refrigeration units and other areas where condensate forms and collects. All these points and areas should be part of a sanitation program.
For most produce handling and processing companies, sanitation has been a part of their operations for decades or for newer companies, since their inception. However, verifying sanitation by testing for environmental pathogens (environmental monitoring) is much more uncommon. Environmental monitoring is one of several activities the Preventive Controls Rule authorizes for verifying the effectiveness of a sanitation program.
If you are doing your own sampling for environmental monitoring purposes, it is important to develop an appropriate plan, including when to sample (before and/or after cleaning), sampling frequency and sampling location as well as training on the proper techniques for employees who do the sampling. Sampling plans should be written as an SOP so sample collection is consistently conducted.
For processing facilities and off-farm packing facilities, the Preventive Controls Rule stipulates that the number and location of sampling sites, and the timing and frequency of collecting and testing samples, “must be adequate to determine whether preventive controls are effective.” The rule also requires that environmental monitoring be scientifically valid and that operators identify the test microorganisms, the test methods used, the laboratory conducting the tests and any corrective actions taken due to the test results.
The FDA and other industry experts recommend that operators first screen test samples for Listeria species, since these tests are generally more rapid. Then test for Listeria monocytogenes as a follow-up for any positive Listeria screen tests. Initially, it may be good to test samples individually, but when your sanitation program has been validated and you are using testing as a verification activity, combining multiple samples from a given area into a composite sample is an effective alternative.
Composite samples allow you to sample more areas without added testing costs while still allowing for follow-up individual testing if a test result comes back positive. In the beginning, you may want to sample before and after cleaning to get a sense of the efficacy of your cleaning and sanitation practices. This information is especially informative to show your cleaning crews the tangible results of their efforts.
After your SSOPs are validated, and you consistently achieve your performance target, you may decide to conduct your environmental monitoring less frequently. It is recommended, however, to increase environmental monitoring activities when changes are made to cleaning personnel, equipment, cleaning processes or other parts of the SSOP.
There is no set formula for calculating the number of samples that are “adequate” to determine whether your controls are effective. Again, it comes down to the fact that you know your operations better than anyone else. You certainly may want to consult experts for advice, but ultimately you need to evaluate your plant, product and processes to determine the amount of sampling that gives you confidence that your sanitation program is effective.
Many trade associations, consulting companies and laboratories that process environmental monitoring samples have staff who are experts on developing sampling plans, and who conduct sample collection training. These and other resources are readily available if you are developing or revising your monitoring programs.
What can I do about all the audits I have to endure?
Audits are a way of life in the produce industry. They are not going away any time soon. While there have been numerous efforts to harmonize audits to reduce their number, many operators still submit to multiple, possibly redundant, audits. It is expensive and time-consuming to prepare individually for each audit, but different audits, and different auditors, have different requirements.
There is no easy solution to this problem. For now, the best you can do is to have a comprehensive, robust food safety program and complete, well-organized documentation to back it up.
This paper has argued that the heart of a robust food safety program is a systematic hazard analysis. A program based on such an analysis, with specific validated activities that address the significant risks, will stand up to any audit. You may not get a perfect score on them all, but you should have little trouble demonstrating the rational basis for what you are doing. With such a program as a base, you need only specifically prepare for the idiosyncrasies of the individual audit, a relatively simple process.
It is important to remember audits are only a measuring tool. Often, operators equate “passing an audit” with a comprehensive food safety program. This paper has shown that a comprehensive food safety program is composed of many foundational programs, with risk assessment as a central theme, to address the risk profile of your specific operation. An audit is a toll that permits you and your customers to assess your adherence to your program.
How can I train my staff to operate all these food safety programs?
The best food safety program will be of little value if it is not implemented properly. Monitoring and verification activities and documentation must all be done correctly. Worker health and hygiene is essential for food safety. These goals can only be achieved through effective and frequent training. Most workers want to do the right thing, but they need guidance.
Teaching general principles is important. All workers need to understand the importance of personal hygiene, proper handwashing and not coming to work sick. If you want workers to perform specific activities, they need to be taught to perform them properly.
Remember also that different people learn differently. Line-workers and field-workers are often poorly educated, and may even be functionally illiterate. Visual learning aids may be more effective than presenting text. Frequent short training sessions may be more effective than infrequent long sessions.
Most of all, training should be validated just like any other food safety activity. If you train workers to measure chlorine concentration in water, test them to validate that they have learned how to do it properly. If you train a crew to perform a sanitation activity, validate that they can do it correctly. In this way, training is no different than any other part of your food safety program.
What comes next?The future of food safety in the produce industry.
The food safety landscape in the U.S. and globally is rapidly evolving, both from a technical and a regulatory standpoint. To paraphrase Yogi Berra, it is always dangerous to make predictions, especially about the future. The new U.S. food safety regulations have clearly had a tremendous impact, even though for many companies, compliance dates are still in the future. The Food Safety Modernization Act of 2011 provides the FDA with additional powers and additional responsibilities including:
The power to order a recall, not just suggest one.
The authority to inspect farming operations.
Food facilities are required to register annually with the FDA. This provision does notinclude farms, restaurants, retail food establishments or nonprofit food establishments in which food is prepared and served directly to consumers.
Registered food facilities are required to conduct hazard analyses and to develop and implement written preventive control plans. The plan must include: hazard analysis, preventive controls, monitoring, verification, corrective actions, and recordkeeping.
Very small facilities and certain kinds of farm activities are exempt from some of therequirements. Nevertheless, this paper strongly recommends that even exempt farms and facilities prepare a hazard analysis plan and substantially follow the regulatory requirements. It just makes good business sense to have the strongest food safety program as is practical.
Food importers are required to implement foreign supplier verification programsand to take steps to verify that the food they import is safe.
Food facilities will be inspected with greater frequency and not less often thanonce every five years.
The FDA is authorized to require that an article of food offered for import is accompanied by a safety certification from an accredited third-party auditor as an additional condition of granting admission.
What does this mean for the produce industry? It means that the FDA is going to expect most operations to have a hazard-analysis-based food safety plan and a workable, efficient recall plan.The new regulations also place greater responsibility on facility operators to:
Construct a rigorous food safety plan
Be able to demonstrate its operation to the FDA
Emphasize allergen controls and food defense plans
With some compliance dates already in effect, now is the time to review your food safety plans to make sure the essential building blocks for a robust, FSMA-compliant program are there and operating as planned.
