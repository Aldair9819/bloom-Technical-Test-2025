Agriculture as Climate Solution: Insights from COP30 and Brazil's Sustainability Leadership
As the global conversation around climate action intensifies, the agricultural sector is stepping up not only as a stakeholder—but as a critical part of the solution. This session will include key takeaways from the recent United Nations COP30 event and explore how these developments intersect with Brazil’s unique environmental landscape.
Panelists will examine Brazil’s growing leadership in sustainable agriculture, the implications of COP30 for global and local produce industries, and how IFPA members can stay ahead of policy, market, and environmental shifts. The discussion will reinforce the powerful narrative that agriculture—particularly in Brazil—is not the cause of climate change, but a vital tool to combat it. Don’t miss this opportunity to align your business with the future of sustainability and climate-smart agriculture.

The challenge: Sustainability is on consumers’ minds, but mixed signals on terminology, safety perceptions and packaging trade offs keep eco friendly produce from fully taking root.
The International Fresh Produce Association surveyed 754 U.S. consumers to explore how sustainability considerations shape produce purchases and to identify actionable strategies that drive both sustainable choices and sales. This section explores local sourcing, packaging impact and eco friendly claims, highlighting opportunities for clear labeling, traceable origin stories and packaging innovation to meet expectations and expand market share.
Sustainability in Mind, But Selectively
Just over half of shoppers consider growing methods and packaging materials when buying produce.
The Opportunity: Elevate clear, certified sustainability claims (organic, recyclable, low pesticide) on front of pack and in store signage.
Local Commands a Premium
Nearly three quarters of consumers are willing to pay more for locally grown produce.
The Opportunity: Spotlight local sourcing through “Farm to Table” labels, regional branding and dedicated shelf sections.
Packaging: Premium vs. Perceived Waste
Almost half of consumers would pay extra for sustainable packaging, yet many still view packaging itself as unnecessary.
The Opportunity: Introduce minimal waste packs that balance protection, and clearly articulate the value of each packaging feature.
Terminology Confusion
Only 20% of Americans understand advanced sustainability terms like carbon farming or climate smart ag—though these buzzwords influence purchase decisions
The Opportunity: Simplify sustainability language with easy scan QR codes, in store info cards and straightforward icons that explain practices in plain English.
Perceived Quality Up
Perceived quality of sustainably produced items has increased in 2024 compared to 2023.
The Opportunity: Spotlight quality, taste, and freshness on packaging of sustainable produced items to further increase consumer preferences for these products.
Quick Wins for Produce Marketers
Launch a “Locally Grown” campaign with premium shelf tags.
Roll out eco minimal packaging piloted in high traffic stores.
Deploy QR codes to educate on sustainability terms.
Feature sustainability “storyboards” in digital ads and social channels.

Procedures for USMCA Covered Items
If your goods meet the USMCA rules of origin, they remain duty-free—but this benefit is not automatic.
Importers must claim preferential treatment based on a certification of origin to avoid tariffs.
Goods that do not meet the rules of origin will not qualify for tariff-free entry.
Products with high amounts of materials from outside North America may not qualify for duty-free status.
Businesses may need to explore alternative sourcing and increase North American content to benefit to qualify for exemption from tariffs.

The challenge: Sustainability is on consumers’ minds, but mixed signals on terminology, safety perceptions and packaging trade offs keep eco friendly produce from fully taking root.
The International Fresh Produce Association surveyed 754 U.S. consumers to explore how sustainability considerations shape produce purchases and to identify actionable strategies that drive both sustainable choices and sales. This section explores local sourcing, packaging impact and eco friendly claims, highlighting opportunities for clear labeling, traceable origin stories and packaging innovation to meet expectations and expand market share.
Sustainability in Mind, But Selectively
Just over half of shoppers consider growing methods and packaging materials when buying produce.
The Opportunity: Elevate clear, certified sustainability claims (organic, recyclable, low pesticide) on front of pack and in store signage.
Local Commands a Premium
Nearly three quarters of consumers are willing to pay more for locally grown produce.
The Opportunity: Spotlight local sourcing through “Farm to Table” labels, regional branding and dedicated shelf sections.
Packaging: Premium vs. Perceived Waste
Almost half of consumers would pay extra for sustainable packaging, yet many still view packaging itself as unnecessary.
The Opportunity: Introduce minimal waste packs that balance protection, and clearly articulate the value of each packaging feature.
Terminology Confusion
Only 20% of Americans understand advanced sustainability terms like carbon farming or climate smart ag—though these buzzwords influence purchase decisions
The Opportunity: Simplify sustainability language with easy scan QR codes, in store info cards and straightforward icons that explain practices in plain English.
Perceived Quality Up
Perceived quality of sustainably produced items has increased in 2024 compared to 2023.
The Opportunity: Spotlight quality, taste, and freshness on packaging of sustainable produced items to further increase consumer preferences for these products.
Quick Wins for Produce Marketers
Launch a “Locally Grown” campaign with premium shelf tags.
Roll out eco minimal packaging piloted in high traffic stores.
Deploy QR codes to educate on sustainability terms.
Feature sustainability “storyboards” in digital ads and social channels.

PFAS in Specialty Crop Production
Share

Key takeaways:
A family of compounds known as PFAS are recognized by regulatory agencies worldwide as a contaminant
PFAS are ubiquitous in households (non-stick cookware, some microwave-safe single-use containers, certain wrinkle-free and stain-free textiles and surface treatments) and in the environment (jet fuel, grease-resistant coatings, firefighting foam).
Repeated FDA supermarket surveys of fresh produce detected either no or only traces of PFAS in fresh produce. Commonly found in shellfish, seafood, some ultra-processed foods.
Soils and ag water in production areas located away from PFAS manufacturing facilities, airports, large urban areas are generally free from PFAS
Common sources of PFAS contamination (biosolids, urban run-off) are already excluded from specialty crop production for FSMA compliance
Executive summary
Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are a large and diverse class of over 12,000 synthetic compounds, recognized as environmental contaminants of concern due to their persistence and potential health risks (National Academy of Sciences, 2022). PFAS can enter the environment through three main pathways--emissions from manufacturing facilities, landfill leachate, and discharges from wastewater treatment plants. Human exposure primarily occurs via ingestion, inhalation, and dermal contact, with ingestion of contaminated food and water being the most common route. Inhalation of dust or airborne PFAS and dermal contact with certain products also contribute to overall exposure. Global regulatory framework aiming to exclude PFAS from foods, waters and the environment is rapidly evolving.
PFAS are ubiquitous and used in thousands of consumer and industrial products, including nonstick cookware, firefighting foams, jet fuel, and protective gear. A review of 52 studies that examined 15 categories of consumer products—encompassing 1,040 individual items—identified 107 distinct PFAS (Dewapriya et al., 2023). PFAS concentrations in consumer products varied widely, ranging from 0.26 parts per trillion (ppt) to 29,000 parts per million (ppm). The highest average concentrations were detected in textiles, followed by household chemicals, then cosmetics. Firefighting products exhibited the highest mean PFAS concentration, with 39 products showing an average of 488.51 ppm (range: 0.11–11,031.30 ppm) (Benotti et al., 2020; Favreau et al., 2017a, 2017b; Fiedler et al., 2010; Herzke et al., 2012; Weiner et al., 2013). Textile finishing agents reported a mean concentration of 302.92 ppm (range: 2.92–1,370.00 ppm) across 12 products (Mumtaz et al., 2019). Ten studies evaluating household chemicals—covering 122 products—had an aggregated mean PFAS concentration of 208.08 ppm (range: 0.0005–3,490.60 ppm) (Blom and Hanssen, 2015; Borg, 2017; Favreau et al., 2017a, 2017b; Fiedler et al., 2010; Guo et al., 2009; Herzke et al., 2012; Kotthoff et al., 2015; Liu et al., 2014, 2015).
FDA repeated sampling of fruit and vegetable samples from retail outlets detected either no PFAS at all or only low traces of PFAS over the 4-year sampling period (2019-2023). Foods of animal origin, on the other hand, were an important contributor to human exposure to PFAS based on the same survey.  Fish and shellfish can accumulate PFAS from polluted waters, making them a notable dietary source. Similarly, animals that graze on contaminated land or drink tainted water may accumulate PFAS in their meat and in dairy products. Drinking water can also become contaminated through leaching from landfills, industrial sites, and other polluted areas.
While biosolids (treated sewage sludge) are often contaminated with PFAS and can contaminate soils, the use of biosolids in horticulture is already limited because of grower’s intent to comply with FSMA.  In the soils that did not experience recent biosolid deposition or a run-off from highly contaminated sites, levels of PFAS are very low (although academic studies detected very low levels of PFAS in remote areas).  Under laboratory conditions, there is evidence of PFAS uptake by plants.

The challenge: While fruits and vegetables remain a must have on most grocery lists, price sensitivity, ambivalence toward packaging, and low brand loyalty mean many shoppers tweak or skip purchases, highlighting actionable strategies for the produce industry.
The International Fresh Produce Association surveyed 754 U.S. consumers to uncover the realities of shopping for fresh fruits and vegetables—how price, packaging and brand influence choices, and which tactics can drive purchases. These findings help the industry refine pricing tiers, innovate packaging features, and tailor messaging to consumer expectations, ultimately driving stronger engagement and higher produce sales.
Price Perception & Action
Most American shoppers see produce prices as fair, although 60% would pay more for quality. Budget pressures still drive most to cut back, with only 30% saying they wouldn’t change their habits if prices rose.
The Opportunity: Highlight value for dollar messaging, tiered pricing, “quality guaranteed” and limited time offers to reassure budget minded shoppers.
Value Added Formats Gain Traction
Nearly 40% of consumers respond to high prices by opting for fresh cut or added value produce (pre washed, portioned, ready to eat).
The Opportunity: Expand and promote mix and match bundles, snack packs and meal kit integrations to meet both cost and convenience needs.
Brand Agnosticism Rules
Produce shoppers are largely brand agnostic, choosing items on price and perceived quality rather than label loyalty.
The Opportunity: Focus on consistent freshness cues (color coding, seal icons) to build trust at shelf.
Packaging Preferences Diverge
46% agree packaging isn’t necessary, yet one third would pay a premium for packaged produce; most buyers rely more on nutrition labels and date codes than on packaging design alone.
The Opportunity: Offer dual lines, minimal, eco friendly packaging alongside premium, informative packs that spotlight nutrition facts, origin stories and extended shelf life.
Quick Wins for Produce Marketers
Clearly label quality and price tiers so shoppers understand what they’re buying.
Scale ready to eat, value added bundles.
Launch a cohesive produce category branding toolkit.
Pilot eco minimal and premium informative packaging with clear date/nutrition callouts.

Microplastics and Nanoplastics in Specialty Crop Production

Key Takeaways:
While micro and nanoplastics are ubiquitous in the environment, health agencies worldwide do not link their presence in the environment with a risk to human health.
Micro and nanoplastics are often found in shellfish and other seafoods.
In the US, major sources of microplastics in the production environment (biosolids, urban run-off, heavily contaminated surface waters) are already excluded from fruit and vegetable production for FSMA compliance.
The majority of reports of microplastics in crop production environment are from Asian countries where overall environmental contamination with plastic waste is alarming. Results of these surveys should not be extrapolated to other regions.
Even when present in soils, most microplastics are not taken up by plants. Some nanoplastics that can be taken up by plants were derived from materials like Styrofoam, which is already being phased out.
Executive Summary
Microplastics (MPs) and nanoplastics (NPs) are ubiquitous in the environment and this presence in the environment and in certain foods increasingly draws attention from consumers and regulators. Public health agencies like the US FDA, Health Canada, and the WHO acknowledge the presence of MPs and NPs in the food supply but emphasize that current scientific evidence does not conclusively show a risk to human health. In the United States, the only direct legislation targeting microplastics is the Microbead-Free Waters Act of 2015 (Public Law 114-114), which bans plastic microbeads in rinse-off personal care products. Broader regulation of MPs and NPs in agriculture, food, and water remains limited, although California requires monitoring and formal definitions for microplastics in drinking water. The European Union has taken a more proactive approach, setting a goal to reduce the presence of MPs in the environment by 30% by 2030 through regulatory actions, while still calling for further study on potential health and environmental effects. Currently, there are no established regulatory limits for MPs or NPs in fresh produce, and public health agencies globally have not yet determined whether existing levels pose a significant health risk. In the US, measures put in place under Food Safety Modernization Act (FSMA) and regulations governing USDA Organic Production indirectly limit introduction of MPs and NPs by putting restrictions on uses of certain soil amendments and management of agricultural water.
MPs have been commonly detected in seafood, meat, honey, and sea salt. We note that retail samples of fresh produce have been very limited, collected from local farmers markets. Data obtained from these samples is difficult to meaningfully interpret as the reported values from independent studies differ by ~100,000 fold.  Around the world, plastic particles can be hypothetically introduced into the fresh produce production environment through various routes, including soil amendments, irrigation water, air deposition, and packaging materials. Occurrence and amounts of MPs and NPs in the crop production environment appear to depend on local environmental conditions and production practices, and most well publicized surveys have been carried out in Asia and Europe. Washing produce has been reported to reduce the number of microplastic particles on surfaces.
While field surveys reported the presence of microplastic particles in the field, laboratory studies on the impact of plastic particles on edible plants typically use much smaller nanoparticles (1-1000 nanometer in size). These laboratory reports indicate that under some laboratory conditions, when present in high concentrations in aquatic suspensions, certain nanoparticles can be taken up by plants. However, these studies often use artificially high concentrations or idealized exposure models, or types of plastic particles that are either unlikely to occur in fields or results from plastics that are already being phased out by the industry. Importantly, detecting and measuring MPs and NPs in soil, water, and plant tissue remains technically challenging, with no universally accepted testing standards. As a result, findings from published studies vary widely and should be interpreted with caution.

The challenge: While a majority of Americans ate the same or more produce as last year, serving size confusion and snack for meal routines prevent it from becoming a true daily habit.
The International Fresh Produce Association surveyed 754 U.S. consumers about their fruit and vegetable consumption. Americans are eating more produce than last year, but many are unsure about the required amounts. Snack habits are shifting, and family routines influence food choices. Marketers can help by clarifying serving sizes, offering convenient snacks, and creating family-friendly experiences.
Fresh Leads the Way
Fresh fruits and vegetables make up about half of all produce intake, with canned, frozen, dried, and juice making up the remainder.
The OpportunityIntroduce more on the go options, like pre washed salad kits, snack size packs and easy prep produce to meet consumers’ need for convenience.
Consumption Momentum
95% of Americans report they ate the same or more produce compared to the previous year, signaling sustained engagement.
The OpportunityAmplify positive consumption stories in marketing to reinforce the trend.
Snack & Side Dynamics
66% of adults regularly replace meals with snacks (up from 59% in 2023), and most children’s snacks are not produce.
The OpportunityDevelop ready to eat produce snacks that satisfy meal replacement occasions.
Knowledge Gaps
Consumers underestimate daily recommended servings, believing an average of 3 cups vs the guideline of 4.
The OpportunityUse packaging, labels and digital tools to educate consumers on proper serving sizes.
Meal Pairing Patterns
Produce is most often consumed as a side dish rather than a center of plate component.
The OpportunityPosition produce as the main ingredients in meal kits, bowls and main dish solutions.
Quick Wins for Produce Marketers
Launch bite sized, on the go produce snack packs.
Integrate clear serving guides on front of packaging.
Collaborate on meal kits that showcase produce as the main ingredient.

The challenge: Reaching American consumers who want to eat healthier but don't always follow through.
The International Fresh Produce Association surveyed 754 U.S. consumers to uncover how Americans think about healthy eating - and how their actions often tell a different story. While the desire to eat well is strong, habits don't always follow.
The study reveals a growing openness to ""food as medicine,"" shifting trust toward physicians over social media, and new dynamics driven by GLP-1 medications. These insights offer fresh opportunities for produce marketers to align with evolving health priorities and consumer behaviors.
Top of Mind, Not Top of Action
Fruits and veggies *should* be a staple. 75% agree they're key to a healthy life. But?
eat what they want, when they want.
The Opportunity: Messaging should focus on helping consumers take the first step - removing friction, offering inspiration and positioning produce as the easiest choice in the moment.
Food Is Medicine: A Growing Preference
60% of Americans would rather change their diet than rely on medication.
The Opportunity: Frame fruits and vegetables as a proactive health strategy in disease prevention. Partner with health-forward influencers and professionals.
Trust the Docs
1 in 4 Americans have been prescribed a health-related diet, and 58% are sticking with it.
The Opportunity: Americans trust doctors more than social media. Build partnerships with clinics and use ""doctor recommended"" messaging.
The GLP-1 Effect
15% of Americans have used GLP-1 drugs (like Ozempic), which often reduce cravings.
The Opportunity: Market produce as satisfying, convenient and ""GLP-1 friendly"" to align with new eating habits.
Smart Social Strategy
Most don't trust social media for nutrition - but YouTube (36%) and Facebook (30%) still lead for those who do.
The Opportunity: Use short, expert-driven content that educates without overselling.
Quick Wins for Produce Marketers
Nudge small, achievable eating shifts.
Elevate ""Food Is Medicine"" messaging.
Collaborate with trusted health voices.
Align packaging with modern appetite changes.
Focus content on high-trust platforms like YouTube & Facebook.
